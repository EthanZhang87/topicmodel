The picometre international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures SI symbol pm or picometer American spelling is a unit of length in the International System of Units SI equal to m or one trillionth of a metre which is the SI base unit of length The picometre is one thousand femtometres one thousandth of a nanometre nm one millionth of a micrometre also known as a micron one billionth of a millimetre and one trillionth of a metre The symbol was once used for it It is also one hundredth of an ngstr m an internationally known but non SI unit of length Use The picometre s length is of an order so small that its application is almost entirely confined to particle physics quantum physics chemistry and acoustics Atoms are between and pm in diameter and the typical length of a carbon carbon single bond is pm Smaller units still may be used to describe smaller particles some of which are the components of atoms themselves such as hadrons and the upper limits of possible size for fermion point particles The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA probe is planned for launch in to directly detect gravitational waves and will measure relative displacements with a resolution of picometres over a distance of gigametres yielding a strain sensitivity of better than part in References
