Carbon fibers or carbon fibres alternatively CF graphite fiber or graphite fibre are fibers about to micrometers in in diameter and composed mostly of carbon atoms Carbon fibers have several advantages high stiffness high tensile strength high strength to weight ratio high chemical resistance high temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion These properties have made carbon fiber very popular in aerospace civil engineering military motorsports and other competition sports However they are relatively expensive compared to similar fibers such as glass fiber basalt fibers or plastic fibers To produce a carbon fiber the carbon atoms are bonded together in crystals that are more or less aligned parallel to the fiber s long axis as the crystal alignment gives the fiber a high strength to volume ratio in other words it is strong for its size Several thousand carbon fibers are bundled together to form a tow which may be used by itself or woven into a fabric Carbon fibers are usually combined with other materials to form a composite For example when permeated with a plastic resin and baked it forms carbon fiber reinforced polymer often referred to as carbon fiber which has a very high strength to weight ratio and is extremely rigid although somewhat brittle Carbon fibers are also composited with other materials such as graphite to form reinforced carbon carbon composites which have a very high heat tolerance Carbon fiber reinforced materials are used to make aircraft and spacecraft parts racing car bodies golf club shafts bicycle frames fishing rods automobile springs sailboat masts and many other components where light weight and high strength are needed History In Joseph Swan produced carbon fibers for the first time for use in light bulbs In Thomas Edison baked cotton threads or bamboo slivers at high temperatures carbonizing them into an all carbon fiber filament used in one of the first incandescent light bulbs to be heated by electricity In Lewis Latimer developed a reliable carbon wire filament for the incandescent light bulb heated by electricity In Roger Bacon created high performance carbon fibers at the Union Carbide Parma Technical Center located outside of Cleveland Ohio Those fibers were manufactured by heating strands of rayon until they carbonized This process proved to be inefficient as the resulting fibers contained only about carbon In the early s a process was developed by Dr Akio Shindo at Agency of Industrial Science and Technology of Japan using polyacrylonitrile PAN as a raw material This had produced a carbon fiber that contained about carbon In Richard Millington of H I Thompson Fiberglas Co developed a process US Patent No for producing a high carbon content fiber using rayon as a precursor These carbon fibers had sufficient strength modulus of elasticity and tensile strength to be used as a reinforcement for composites having high strength to weight properties and for high temperature resistant applications The high potential strength of carbon fiber was realized in in a process developed by W Watt L N Phillips and W Johnson at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough Hampshire The process was patented by the UK Ministry of Defence then licensed by the British National Research Development Corporation to three companies Rolls Royce who were already making carbon fiber Morganite and Courtaulds Within a few years after successful use in of a Hyfil carbon fiber fan assembly in the Rolls Royce Conway jet engines of the Vickers VC Rolls Royce took advantage of the new material s properties to break into the American market with its RB aero engine with carbon fiber compressor blades Unfortunately the blades proved vulnerable to damage from bird impact This problem and others caused Rolls Royce such setbacks that the company was nationalized in The carbon fiber production plant was sold off to form Bristol Composite Materials Engineering Ltd often referred to as Bristol Composites In the late s the Japanese took the lead in manufacturing PAN based carbon fibers A joint technology agreement allowed Union Carbide to manufacture Japan s Toray Industries product Morganite decided that carbon fiber production was peripheral to its core business leaving Courtaulds as the only big UK manufacturer Courtaulds s water based inorganic process made the product susceptible to impurities that did not affect the organic process used by other carbon fiber manufacturers leading Courtaulds ceasing carbon fiber production in During the s experimental work to find alternative raw materials led to the introduction of carbon fibers made from a petroleum pitch derived from oil processing These fibers contained about carbon and had excellent flexural strength Also during this period the Japanese Government heavily supported carbon fiber development at home and several Japanese companies such as Toray Nippon Carbon Toho Rayon and Mitsubishi started their own development and production Since the late s further types of carbon fiber yarn entered the global market offering higher tensile strength and higher elastic modulus For example T from Toray with a tensile strength of MPa and M a modulus of GPa Intermediate carbon fibers such as IM from Toho Rayon with up to MPa were developed Carbon fibers from Toray Celanese and Akzo found their way to aerospace application from secondary to primary parts first in military and later in civil aircraft as in McDonnell Douglas Boeing Airbus and United Aircraft Corporation planes In Dr Jacob Lahijani invented balanced ultra high Young s modulus greater than Mpsi and high tensile strength pitch carbon fiber greater than kpsi used extensively in automotive and aerospace applications In March the patent was assigned to the University of Tennessee Research Foundation Structure and properties Carbon fiber is frequently supplied in the form of a continuous tow wound onto a reel The tow is a bundle of thousands of continuous individual carbon filaments held together and protected by an organic coating or size such as polyethylene oxide PEO or polyvinyl alcohol PVA The tow can be conveniently unwound from the reel for use Each carbon filament in the tow is a continuous cylinder with a diameter of micrometers and consists almost exclusively of carbon The earliest generation e g T HTA and AS had diameters of micrometers Later fibers e g IM or IM have diameters that are approximately micrometers The atomic structure of carbon fiber is similar to that of graphite consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern graphene sheets the difference being in the way these sheets interlock Graphite is a crystalline material in which the sheets are stacked parallel to one another in regular fashion The intermolecular forces between the sheets are relatively weak Van der Waals forces giving graphite its soft and brittle characteristics Depending upon the precursor to make the fiber carbon fiber may be turbostratic or graphitic or have a hybrid structure with both graphitic and turbostratic parts present In turbostratic carbon fiber the sheets of carbon atoms are haphazardly folded or crumpled together Carbon fibers derived from polyacrylonitrile PAN are turbostratic whereas carbon fibers derived from mesophase pitch are graphitic after heat treatment at temperatures exceeding C Turbostratic carbon fibers tend to have high ultimate tensile strength whereas heat treated mesophase pitch derived carbon fibers have high Young s modulus i e high stiffness or resistance to extension under load and high thermal conductivity Applications Carbon fiber can have higher cost than other materials which has been one of the limiting factors of adoption In a comparison between steel and carbon fiber materials for automotive materials carbon fiber may be x more expensive However this cost premium has come down over the past decade from estimates of x more expensive than steel in the early s Composite materials Carbon fiber is most notably used to reinforce composite materials particularly the class of materials known as carbon fiber or graphite reinforced polymers Non polymer materials can also be used as the matrix for carbon fibers Due to the formation of metal carbides and corrosion considerations carbon has seen limited success in metal matrix composite applications Reinforced carbon carbon RCC consists of carbon fiber reinforced graphite and is used structurally in high temperature applications The fiber also finds use in filtration of high temperature gases as an electrode with high surface area and impeccable corrosion resistance and as an anti static component Molding a thin layer of carbon fibers significantly improves fire resistance of polymers or thermoset composites because a dense compact layer of carbon fibers efficiently reflects heat The increasing use of carbon fiber composites is displacing aluminum from aerospace applications in favor of other metals because of galvanic corrosion issues Note however that carbon fiber does not eliminate the risk of galvanic corrosion In contact with metal it forms a perfect galvanic corrosion cell and the metal will be subjected to galvanic corrosion attack unless a sealant is applied between the metal and the carbon fiber Carbon fiber can be used as an additive to asphalt to make electrically conductive asphalt concrete Using this composite material in the transportation infrastructure especially for airport pavement decreases some winter maintenance problems that lead to flight cancellation or delay due to the presence of ice and snow Passing current through the composite material D network of carbon fibers dissipates thermal energy that increases the surface temperature of the asphalt which is able to melt ice and snow above it Textiles Precursors for carbon fibers are polyacrylonitrile PAN rayon and pitch Carbon fiber filament yarns are used in several processing techniques the direct uses are for prepregging filament winding pultrusion weaving braiding etc Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density weight per unit length i e g m tex or by number of filaments per yarn count in thousands For example tex for filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as carbon filament yarn but is also three times as heavy This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen Some commonly used types of weave are twill satin and plain Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided Microelectrodes Carbon fibers are used for fabrication of carbon fiber microelectrodes In this application typically a single carbon fiber with diameter of m is sealed in a glass capillary At the tip the capillary is either sealed with epoxy and polished to make a carbon fiber disk microelectrode or the fiber is cut to a length of m to make a carbon fiber cylinder electrode Carbon fiber microelectrodes are used either in amperometry or fast scan cyclic voltammetry for detection of biochemical signaling Flexible heating Despite being known for their electrical conductivity carbon fibers can carry only very low currents on their own When woven into larger fabrics they can be used to reliably provide infrared heating in applications requiring flexible electrical heating elements and can easily sustain temperatures past C Many examples of this type of application can be seen in DIY heated articles of clothing and blankets Due to its chemical inertness it can be used relatively safely amongst most fabrics and materials however shorts caused by the material folding back on itself will lead to increased heat production and can lead to a fire Synthesis Each carbon filament is produced from a polymer such as polyacrylonitrile PAN rayon or petroleum pitch All these polymers are known as a precursor For synthetic polymers such as PAN or rayon the precursor is first spun into filament yarns using chemical and mechanical processes to initially align the polymer molecules in a way to enhance the final physical properties of the completed carbon fiber Precursor compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning filament yarns may vary among manufacturers After drawing or spinning the polymer filament yarns are then heated to drive off non carbon atoms carbonization producing the final carbon fiber The carbon fibers filament yarns may be further treated to improve handling qualities then wound on to bobbins A common method of manufacture involves heating the spun PAN filaments to approximately C in air which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material The oxidized PAN is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon and heated to approximately C which induces graphitization of the material changing the molecular bond structure When heated in the correct conditions these chains bond side to side ladder polymers forming narrow graphene sheets which eventually merge to form a single columnar filament The result is usually carbon Lower quality fiber can be manufactured using pitch or rayon as the precursor instead of PAN The carbon can become further enhanced as high modulus or high strength carbon by heat treatment processes Carbon heated in the range of C carbonization exhibits the highest tensile strength MPa or psi while carbon fiber heated from to C graphitizing exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity GPa or psi See also Basalt fiber Carbon fiber reinforced polymer Carbon fiber reinforced ceramic material Carbon nanotube ESD materials Graphene
