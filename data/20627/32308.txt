United States customary units often incorrectly referred to as imperial units form a system of measurement units commonly used in the United States and most U S territories since being standardized and adopted in The United States customary system developed from English units that were in use in the British Empire before the U S became an independent country The United Kingdom s system of measures was overhauled in to create the imperial system with imperial units which was officially adopted in changing the definitions of some of its units Consequently while many U S units are essentially similar to their imperial counterparts there are noticeable differences between the systems The majority of U S customary units were redefined in terms of the meter and kilogram with the Mendenhall Order of and in practice for many years before These definitions were refined by the international yard and pound agreement of The United States uses customary units in commercial activities as well as for personal and social use In science medicine many sectors of industry and some government and military areas metric units are used The International System of Units SI the modern form of the metric system is preferred for many uses by the U S National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST For newer types of measurement where there is no traditional customary unit international units are used sometimes mixed with customary units for example electrical resistance of wire expressed in ohms SI per thousand feet History The United States system of units of is based on the system in use in Britain prior to the introduction to the British imperial system on January Both systems are derived from English units a system which had evolved over the millennia before American independence and which had its roots in both Roman and Anglo Saxon units The customary system was championed by the U S based International Institute for Preserving and Perfecting Weights and Measures in the late th century Some advocates of the customary system saw the French Revolutionary or metric system as atheistic The president of an Ohio auxiliary of the Institute wrote that the traditional units were a just weight and a just measure which alone are acceptable to the Lord His organization later went so far as to publish music for a song proclaiming down with every metric scheme The U S government passed the Metric Conversion Act of which made the metric system the preferred system of weights and measures for U S trade and commerce The legislation states that the federal government has a responsibility to assist industry as it voluntarily converts to the metric system i e metrification This is most evident in U S labeling requirements on food products where SI units are almost always presented alongside customary units According to the CIA World Factbook the United States is one of three nations along with Liberia and Myanmar Burma that have not adopted the metric system as their official system of weights and measures Executive Order signed by President George H W Bush on July citing the Metric Conversion Act directed departments and agencies within the executive branch of the United States Government to take all appropriate measures within their authority to use the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce and authorized the Secretary of Commerce to charter an Interagency Council on Metric Policy ICMP which will assist the Secretary in coordinating Federal Government wide implementation of this order U S customary units are widely used on consumer products and in industrial manufacturing Metric units are standard in science medicine as well as many sectors of industry and government including the military There are anecdotal objections to the use of metric units in carpentry and the building trades on the basis that it is easier to remember an integer number of inches plus a fraction than a measurement in millimeters or that foot inch measurements are more suitable when distances are frequently divided into halves thirds and quarters often in parallel The metric system also lacks a parallel measurement to the foot The term United States customary units was used by the former United States National Bureau of Standards although English units is sometimes used in colloquial speech Length For measuring length the U S customary system uses the inch foot yard and mile which are the only four customary length measurements in everyday use From the foot was legally defined as exactly m approximately m Since July the units of length have been defined on the basis of yd m The U S the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries agreed on this definition per the International Yard and Pound Agreement of At the time of the agreement the basic geodetic datum in North America was the North American Datum of NAD which had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of that is ft m this definition was retained for data derived from NAD but renamed the US survey foot to distinguish it from the international foot For most applications the difference between the two definitions is insignificant one international foot is exactly of a US survey foot for a difference of about in mm per mile but it affects the definition of the State Plane Coordinate Systems SPCSs which can stretch over hundreds of miles The NAD was replaced in the s by the North American Datum of NAD which is defined in meters The SPCSs were also updated but the U S National Geodetic Survey left the decision of which if any definition of the foot to use to the individual states and other jurisdictions All SPCS systems are defined in meters but forty jurisdictions also use the survey foot six use the international foot and ten do not specify which if any foot type should be used In the NIST working with the National Geodetic Survey NGS National Ocean Service NOS National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and Department of Commerce DOC issued a Federal Register Notice FRN indicating the deprecation of the U S survey foot and U S survey mile units from December In the following tables in this and subsequent sections the most common measures are shown in italics and approximate values are shown in parentheses values not in parentheses are exact International units International nautical units US survey units Note that as announced by the National Institute of Standards and Technology the US survey foot and other units defined in terms of it have been deprecated since except for historic and legacy applications Area The most widely used area unit with a name unrelated to any length unit is the acre The National Institute of Standards and Technology formerly contended that customary area units are defined in terms of the square survey foot not the square international foot but from it states that although historically defined using the U S survey foot the statute mile can be defined using either definition of the foot as is the case for all other units listed in this table However use of definitions based on the U S survey foot should be avoided after December except for historic and legacy applications Volume The cubic inch cubic foot and cubic yard are commonly used for measuring volume In addition there is one group of units for measuring volumes of liquids based on the wine gallon and subdivisions of the fluid ounce and one for measuring volumes of dry material each with their own names and sub units Although the units and their names are similar to the units in the imperial system and many units are shared between the two systems as a whole with respect to volume however this is quite the contrary The independence of the U S from the British Empire decades prior to the reformation of units in most notably the gallon its subdivisions and in mass higher combinations above the pound is the cause of the differences in values As a non participant in that reform the U S retained the separate systems for measuring the volumes of liquids and dry material whereas the imperial system had unified the units for both under a new imperial gallon The U S uses the pre gallon cubic inches cm and Winchester bushel cubic inches cm as opposed to British definition of imperial gallon L US gal lb kg of water and the bushel as imperial gallons L US gal Fluid volume One US fluid ounce is of a US pint of a US quart and of a US gallon The teaspoon tablespoon and cup are defined in terms of a fluid ounce as and fluid ounces respectively The fluid ounce derives its name originally from being the volume of one ounce avoirdupois of water but in the US it is defined as of a US gallon Consequently a fluid ounce of water weighs about ounces avoirdupois For nutritional labeling and medicine in the US the teaspoon and tablespoon are defined as a metric teaspoon and tablespoon precisely mL and mL respectively The saying a pint s a pound the world around refers to US fluid ounces of water weighing approximately about more than one pound avoirdupois An imperial pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter oz There are varying standards for barrel for some specific commodities including gallons for beer gallons for whiskey or kerosene and gallons for petroleum The general standard for liquids is gal or half a hogshead The common gallon size of drum for storing and transporting various products and wastes is sometimes confused with a barrel though it is not a standard measure In the U S single servings of beverages are usually measured in fluid ounces Milk is usually sold in half pints fluid ounces pints quarts half gallons and gallons Water volume for sinks bathtubs ponds swimming pools etc is usually stated in gallons or cubic feet Quantities of gases are usually given in cubic feet at one atmosphere Minims drams gill and pottle are rarely used currently The gill is often referred to as a half cup The pottle is often referred to as a half gallon Dry volume Dry volume is measured on a separate system although many of the names remain the same Small fruits and vegetables are often sold in dry pints and dry quarts The US dry gallon is less commonly used and was not included in the handbook that many states recognize as the authority on measurement law However pecks or bushels are sometimes used particularly for grapes apples and similar fruits in agricultural regions Mass and weight There have historically been five different English systems of mass tower apothecaries troy avoirdupois and metric Of these the avoirdupois weight is the most common system used in the U S although Troy weight is still used to weigh precious metals Apothecaries weight once used by pharmacies has been largely replaced by metric measurements Tower weight fell out of use in England due to legal prohibition in centuries ago and was never used in the U S The imperial system which is still used for some measures in the United Kingdom and other countries is based on avoirdupois with variations from U S customary units larger than a pound The pound avoirdupois which forms the basis of the U S customary system of mass is defined as exactly grams by agreement between the U S the United Kingdom and other English speaking countries in Other units of mass are defined in terms of it The avoirdupois pound is legally defined as a measure of mass but the name pound is also applied to measures of force For instance in many contexts the pound avoirdupois is used as a unit of mass but in some contexts the term pound is used to refer to pound force The slug is another unit of mass derived from pound force Troy weight avoirdupois weight and apothecaries weight are all built from the same basic unit the grain which is the same in all three systems However while each system has some overlap in the names of their units of measure all have ounces and pounds the relationship between the grain and these other units within each system varies For example in apothecary and troy weight the pound and ounce are the same but are different from the pound and ounce in avoirdupois in terms of their relationships to grains and to each other The systems also have different units between the grain and ounce apothecaries has scruple and dram troy has pennyweight and avoirdupois has just dram sometimes spelled drachm The dram in avoirdupois weighs just under half of the dram in apothecaries The fluid dram unit of volume is based on the weight of dram of water in the apothecaries system To alleviate confusion it is typical when publishing non avoirdupois weights to mention the name of the system along with the unit Precious metals for example are often weighed in troy ounces because just ounce would be more likely to be assumed to mean an avoirdupois ounce For the pound and smaller units the U S customary system and the British imperial system are identical However they differ when dealing with units larger than the pound The definition of the pound avoirdupois in the imperial system is identical to that in the U S customary system In the U S only the ounce pound and short ton known in the country simply as the ton are commonly used though the hundredweight is still used in agriculture and shipping The grain is used to describe the mass of propellant and projectiles in small arms ammunition It was also used to measure medicine and other very small masses Grain measures In agricultural practice a bushel is a fixed volume of cubic inches liters The mass of grain will therefore vary according to density Some nominal weight examples are bushel corn lb kg bushel wheat lb kg bushel barley lb kg Cooking measures The most common practical cooking measures for both liquid and dry ingredients in the U S are teaspoon tablespoon and cup along with halves thirds quarters and eighths of each Units used are pounds ounces and fluid ounces Common sizes are also used such as can presumed size varies depending on product jar square e g of chocolate stick e g of butter or portion of fruit or vegetable e g a half lemon two medium onions Temperature Degrees Fahrenheit are used in the U S to measure temperatures in most non scientific contexts The Rankine scale of absolute temperature also saw some use in thermodynamics Scientists worldwide use the kelvin and degree Celsius Several U S technical standards are expressed in Fahrenheit temperatures and some American medical practitioners use degrees Fahrenheit for body temperature The relationship between the different temperature scales is linear but the scales have different zero points so conversion is not simply multiplication by a factor Pure water freezes at F C and boils at F C at atm The conversion formula is or inversely as Other units Length hand in mm U rack unit in mm Volume board foot

for most metal wire Scoop utensil sizes numbered by scoops per quart Thickness of leather is measured in ounces oz equals inch mm Bolts and screws follow the Unified Thread Standard rather than the ISO metric screw thread standard Knitting needles in the United States are measured according to a non linear unitless numerical system Thickness of aluminum foil is measured in mils inch or mm in the United States Cross sectional area of electrical wire is measured in circular mils in the U S and Canada one circular mil cmil being equal to mm or in Since this is so small actual wire is commonly measured in thousands of a cmil called either kcmil or MCM The mil or thou is also sometimes used to mean thousandth of an inch Sheet metal in the U S is commonly measured in gauge not to be confused with the American wire gauge which is derived from weight and thus differs by material Nominal Pipe Size is used for the outside diameter of pipes Below NPS the NPS number is not consistent with the pipe diameter in inches Copper tubing however is measured in nominal size inch less than the outside diameter The Schedule system is used for standard pipe thicknesses Alcohol content is frequently given in proof percent alcohol by volume The cord is used for volume of firewood The square is used to mean square feet in construction Heat flux in the U S is measured in langleys Other names for U S customary units The United States Code refers to these units as traditional systems of weights and measures Other common ways of referring to the system are customary standard English or imperial which refers to the post reform measures used throughout the British Empire Commonwealth countries Another term is the foot pound second FPS system as opposed to centimeter gram second CGS and meter kilogram second MKS systems Tools and fasteners with sizes measured in inches are sometimes called SAE bolts or SAE wrenches to differentiate them from their metric counterparts The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE originally developed fasteners standards using U S units for the U S auto industry the organization now uses metric units See also Board foot Conversion of units History of
