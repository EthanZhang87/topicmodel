id: 26874
A metric prefix is a unit prefix that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a multiple or submultiple of the unit All metric prefixes used today are decadic Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to any unit symbol The prefix kilo for example may be added to gram to indicate multiplication by one thousand one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams The prefix milli likewise may be added to metre to indicate division by one thousand one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre Decimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the metric system with six of these dating back to the system s introduction in the s Metric prefixes have also been used with some non metric units The SI prefixes are metric prefixes that were standardised for use in the International System of Units SI by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM in resolutions dating from to Since they have formed part of the ISO IEC standard They are also used in the Unified Code for Units of Measure UCUM List of SI prefixes The BIPM specifies twenty four prefixes for the International System of Units SI The first uses of prefixes in SI date back to the definition of kilogram after the French Revolution at the end of the th century Several more prefixes came into use and were recognised by the IUPAC th International Conference of Chemistry before being officially adopted for the first time in The most recent prefixes adopted were ronna quetta ronto and quecto in after a proposal from British metrologist Richard J C Brown The large prefixes ronna and quetta were adopted in anticipation of needs for use in data science and because unofficial prefixes that did not meet SI requirements were already circulating The small prefixes were also added even without such a driver in order to maintain symmetry Rules The symbols for the units of measure are combined with the symbols for each prefix name The SI symbols for kilometre kilogram and kilowatt for instance are km kg and kW respectively The symbol for kilo is k Except for the early prefixes of kilo hecto and deca the symbols for the prefixes for multiples are uppercase letters and those for the prefixes for submultiples are lowercase letters All of the metric prefix symbols are made from upper and lower case Latin letters except for the symbol for micro which is uniquely a Greek letter Like the numbers they combine with SI units and unit symbols are never shown in italics The prefixes and their symbols are always prefixed to the symbol for the unit without any intervening space or punctuation This distinguishes a prefixed unit symbol from the product of unit symbols for which a space or mid height dot as separator is required So for instance while ms means millisecond m s or m s means metre second Prefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred the prefixes corresponding to tens deci deca and hundreds centi hecto are less common and are disfavoured in certain fields Hence m is preferred over hm hectometre or dam decametres The prefixes deci and centi and less frequently hecto and deca are generally used for informal purposes the centimetre cm is especially common Some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre because use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion These prefixes are also commonly used to create metric units corresponding to older conventional units for example hectares and hectopascals Prefixes may not be used in combination on a single symbol This includes the case of the base unit kilogram which already contains a prefix For example milligram mg is used instead of microkilogram kg During mathematical operations prefixes are treated as multiplicative factors For example km is treated as m which allows all quantities based on the same unit to be factored together even if they have different prefixes A prefix symbol attached to a unit symbol is included when the unit is raised to a power For example km denotes km km m not m Usage Examples The mass of an electron is about rg rontogram The mass of litre of water is about kg kilogram The mass of the Earth is about Rg ronnagrams The mass of Jupiter is about Qg quettagrams Examples of powers of units with metric prefixes km means one square kilometre or the area of a square of m by m In other words an area of square metres and not square metres Mm means two cubic megametres or the volume of two cubes of m by m by m i e m and not cubic metres m Examples with prefixes and powers mV mA V A V A W mV V mV mV mV cm m m m km m m m m m MW W W W Micro symbol When mega and micro were adopted in there were then three prefixes starting with m so it was necessary to use some other symbol besides upper and lowercase m Eventually the Greek letter was adopted However with the lack of a key on most typewriters as well as computer keyboards various other abbreviations remained common including mc mic and u From about onwards u prevailed in type written documents Because ASCII EBCDIC and other common encodings lacked code points for this tradition remained even as computers replaced typewriters When ISO was created it included the symbol for micro at codepoint xB The whole of ISO was incorporated into the initial version of Unicode but subsequently Unicode version deprecated the micro symbol on codepoint U b in favour of the Greek letter on codepoint U bc Keyboard entry Most keyboards do not have a key so it is necessary to use a key code this varies depending on the operating system physical keyboard layout and user s language For all keyboard layouts On Microsoft Windows systems arbitrary Unicode codepoints can be entered in decimal with Alt sustained and releasing Alt A leading is required this registers as the corresponding Unicode hexadecimal code point xB or arbitrary Unicode codepoints can be entered in hexadecimal as Alt b up to hexadecimal characters not counting the leading upper or lower case or in the tradition of MS DOS IBM code page one can also enter old code points in decimal Alt the leading zero must be omitted On Linux systems under X when a Compose key has been enabled Composemu under X with ibus version or higher active and a non composing input method selected The default keybinding for starting codepoint input is Ctrl Shift u The key sequence Ctrl Shift u b space then produces U B the micro sign on the VGA console s virtual terminals like tty arbitrary Unicode codepoints can be entered in decimal as Alt sustained and releasing Alt A leading is not required For QWERTY keyboard layouts On Linux systems code point U b can be entered as right alt m provided the right alt key is configured to act as AltGr On MacOS systems code point U b can be entered as either Opt m or Opt Y Typesetting in Latex The LaTeX typesetting system features an SIunitx package in which the units of measurement are spelled out for example qty tera hertz formats as THz Application to units of measurement The use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the s long before the introduction of the SI The prefixes including those introduced after are used with any metric unit whether officially included in the SI or not e g millidyne and milligauss Metric prefixes may also be used with some non metric units but not for example with the non SI units of time Metric units Mass The units kilogram gram milligram microgram and smaller are commonly used for measurement of mass However megagram gigagram and larger are rarely used tonnes and kilotonnes megatonnes etc or scientific notation are used instead The megagram does not share the risk of confusion that the tonne has with other units with the name ton The kilogram is the only coherent unit of the International System of Units that includes a metric prefix Volume The litre equal to a cubic decimetre millilitre equal to a cubic centimetre microlitre and smaller are common In Europe the centilitre is often used for liquids and the decilitre is used less frequently Bulk agricultural products such as grain beer and wine often use the hectolitre litres Larger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres megalitres or gigalitres or else in cubic metres cubic metre kilolitre or cubic kilometres cubic kilometre teralitre For scientific purposes the cubic metre is usually used Length The kilometre metre centimetre millimetre and smaller units are common The decimetre is rarely used The micrometre is often referred to by the older non SI name micron In some fields such as chemistry the ngstr m nm has been used commonly instead of the nanometre The femtometre used mainly in particle physics is sometimes called a fermi For large scales megametre gigametre and larger are rarely used Instead ad hoc non metric units are used such as the solar radius astronomical units light years and parsecs the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non SI unit Time Prefixes for the SI standard unit second are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second For larger quantities the system of minutes seconds hours minutes and days hours is accepted for use with the SI and more commonly used When speaking of spans of time the length of the day is usually standardised to seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular leap second Larger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts but are seldom used in common parlance For long scale scientific work particularly in astronomy the Julian year or annum a is a standardised variant of the year equal to exactly seconds days The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the Julian calendar Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum such as megaannum Ma or gigaannum Ga Angle The SI unit of angle is the radian but degrees as well as arc minutes and arc seconds see some scientific use Temperature Common practice does not typically use the flexibility allowed by official policy in the case of the degree Celsius C NIST states Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol C and prefix names may be used with the unit name degree Celsius For example m C millidegrees Celsius is acceptable In practice it is more common for prefixes to be used with the kelvin when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences Thus temperatures of star interiors may be given with the unit of MK megakelvin and molecular cooling may be given with the unit mK millikelvin Energy In use the joule and kilojoule are common with larger multiples seen in limited contexts In addition the kilowatt hour a composite unit formed from the kilowatt and hour is often used for electrical energy other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt e g terawatt hour There exist a number of definitions for the non SI unit the calorie There are gram calories and kilogram calories One kilogram calorie which equals one thousand gram calories often appears capitalised and without a prefix i e Cal when referring to dietary calories in food It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie but not to the kilogram calorie thus kcal cal Cal Non metric units Metric prefixes are widely used outside the metric SI system Common examples include the megabyte and the decibel Metric prefixes rarely appear with imperial or US units except in some special cases e g microinch kilofoot kilopound They are also used with other specialised units used in particular fields e g megaelectronvolt gigaparsec millibarn kilodalton In astronomy geology and palaeontology the year with symbol a from the Latin annus is commonly used with metric prefixes ka Ma and Ga Official policies about the use of SI prefixes with non SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures BIPM and the American National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST For instance the NIST advises that to avoid confusion prefix symbols and prefix names are not used with the time related unit symbols names min minute h hour d day nor with the angle related symbols names degree minute and second whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol as for arcsecond when they state However astronomers use milliarcsecond which they denote mas and microarcsecond as which they use as units for measuring very small angles Non standard prefixes Obsolete metric prefixes Some of the prefixes formerly used in the metric system have fallen into disuse and were not adopted into the SI The decimal prefix for ten thousand myria sometimes spelt myrio and the early binary prefixes double and demi were parts of the original metric system adopted by France in but were not retained when the SI prefixes were internationally adopted by the th CGPM conference in Other metric prefixes used historically include hebdo and micri Double prefixes Double prefixes have been used in the past such as micromillimetres or millimicrons now nanometres micromicrofarads F now picofarads pF kilomegatonnes now gigatonnes hectokilometres now kilometres and the derived adjective hectokilometric typically used for qualifying the fuel consumption measures These are not compatible with the SI Other obsolete double prefixes included decimilli which was contracted to dimi and standardised in France up to There are no more letters of the Latin alphabet available for new prefixes all the unused letters are already used for units As such Richard J C Brown who proposed the prefixes adopted for and has proposed a reintroduction of compound prefixes e g kiloquetta for if a driver for prefixes at such scales ever materialises with a restriction that the last prefix must always be quetta or quecto This usage has not been approved by the BIPM Similar symbols and abbreviations In written English the symbol K is often used informally to indicate a multiple of thousand in many contexts For example one may talk of a K salary or call the Year problem the Y K problem In these cases an uppercase K is often used with an implied unit although it could then be confused with the symbol for the kelvin temperature unit if the context is unclear This informal postfix is read or spoken as thousand or grand or just k The financial and general news media mostly use m or M b or B and t or T as abbreviations for million billion and trillion respectively for large quantities typically currency and population The medical and automotive fields in the United States use the abbreviations cc or ccm for cubic centimetres One cubic centimetre is equal to one millilitre For nearly a century engineers used the abbreviation MCM to designate a thousand circular mils in specifying the cross sectional area of large electrical cables Since the mid s kcmil has been adopted as the official designation of a thousand circular mils but the designation MCM still remains in wide use A similar system is used in natural gas sales in the United States m or M for thousands and mm or MM for millions of British thermal units or therms and in the oil industry where MMbbl is the symbol for millions of barrels This usage of the capital letter M for thousand is from Roman numerals in which M means See also Footnotes References External links International Bureau of Weights and Measures
