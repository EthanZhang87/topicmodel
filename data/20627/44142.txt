The metric system is a decimal based system of measurement The current international standard for the metric system is the International System of Units Syst me international d unit s or SI in which all units can be expressed in terms of seven base units the metre kilogram second ampere kelvin mole and candela Prefixes for multiples and submultiples In the metric system multiples and submultiples of units follow a decimal pattern A common set of decimal based prefixes that have the effect of multiplication or division by an integer power of ten can be applied to units that are themselves too large or too small for practical use The prefix kilo for example is used to multiply the unit by and the prefix milli is to indicate a one thousandth part of the unit Thus the kilogram and kilometre are a thousand grams and metres respectively and a milligram and millimetre are one thousandth of a gram and metre respectively These relations can be written symbolically as Definitions of the metric system units The decimalised system based on the metre which had been introduced in France in the s The historical development of these systems culminated in the definition of the International System of Units SI in the mid th century under the oversight of an international standards body Adopting the metric system is known as metrication The historical evolution of metric systems has resulted in the recognition of several principles A set of independent dimensions of nature is selected in terms of which all natural quantities can be expressed called base quantities For each of these dimensions a representative quantity is defined as a base unit of measure The definition of base units has increasingly been realised in terms of fundamental natural phenomena in preference to copies of physical artefacts A unit derived from the base units is used for expressing quantities of dimensions that can be derived from the base dimensions of the system e g the square metre is the derived unit for area which is derived from length These derived units are coherent which means that they involve only products of powers of the base units without any further factors For any given quantity whose unit has a name and symbol an extended set of smaller and larger units is defined that are related by factors of powers of ten The unit of time should be the second the unit of length should be either the metre or a decimal multiple of it and the unit of mass should be the gram or a decimal multiple of it Metric systems have evolved since the s as science and technology have evolved in providing a single universal measuring system Before and in addition to the SI metric systems include the MKS system of units and the MKSA systems which are the direct forerunners of the SI the centimetre gram second CGS system and its subtypes the CGS electrostatic cgs esu system the CGS electromagnetic cgs emu system and their still popular blend the Gaussian system the metre tonne second MTS system and the gravitational metric systems which can be based on either the metre or the centimetre and either the gram gram force kilogram or kilogram force The SI has been adopted as the official system of weights and measures by nearly all nations in the world History of the current metric system The French Revolution provided an opportunity for the French to reform their unwieldy and archaic system of many local weights and measures Charles Maurice de Talleyrand championed a new system based on natural units proposing to the French National Assembly in that such a system be developed Talleyrand had ambitions that a new natural and standardised system would be embraced worldwide and was keen to involve other countries in its development Great Britain ignored invitations to co operate so the French Academy of Sciences decided in to go it alone and they set up a commission for the purpose The commission decided that the standard of length should be based on the size of the Earth They defined that length to be the metre and its length as one ten millionth of the length of an Earth quadrant the length of the meridian arc on the Earth s surface from the equator to the north pole In after the arc measurement had been surveyed the new system was launched in France The units of the metric system originally taken from observable features of nature are now defined by seven physical constants being given exact numerical values in terms of the units In the modern form of the International System of Units SI the seven base units are metre for length kilogram for mass second for time ampere for electric current kelvin for temperature candela for luminous intensity and mole for amount of substance These together with their derived units can measure any physical quantity Derived units may have their own unit name such as the watt J s and lux cd m or may just be expressed as combinations of base units such as velocity m s and acceleration m s The metric system was designed to have properties that make it easy to use and widely applicable including units based on the natural world decimal ratios prefixes for multiples and sub multiples and a structure of base and derived units It is a coherent system which means that its units do not introduce conversion factors not already present in equations relating quantities The metric system is extensible and new derived units are defined as needed in fields such as radiology and chemistry For example the katal a derived unit for catalytic activity equivalent to one mole per second mol s was added in Principles Although the metric system has changed and developed since its inception its basic concepts have hardly changed Designed for transnational use it consisted of a basic set of units of measurement now known as base units Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal based and identified by a standard set of prefixes Realisation The base units used in a measurement system must be realisable Each of the definitions of the base units in the SI is accompanied by a defined mise en pratique practical realisation that describes in detail at least one way in which the base unit can be measured Where possible definitions of the base units were developed so that any laboratory equipped with proper instruments would be able to realise a standard without reliance on an artefact held by another country In practice such realisation is done under the auspices of a mutual acceptance arrangement In the SI the standard metre is defined as exactly of the distance that light travels in a second The metre can be realised by measuring the length that a light wave travels in a given time or equivalently by measuring the wavelength of light of a known frequency The kilogram was originally defined as the mass of one cubic decimetre of water at C standardized as the mass of a man made artefact of platinum iridium held in a laboratory in France which was used until a new definition was introduced in May Replicas made in at the time of the artefact s fabrication and distributed to signatories of the Metre Convention serve as de facto standards of mass in those countries Additional replicas have been fabricated since as additional countries have joined the convention The replicas were subject to periodic validation by comparison to the original called the IPK It became apparent that either the IPK or the replicas or both were deteriorating and are no longer comparable they had diverged by g since fabrication so figuratively the accuracy of the kilogram was no better than parts in a hundred million or a relative accuracy of The accepted redefinition of SI base units replaced the IPK with an exact definition of the Planck constant as expressed in SI units which defines the kilogram in terms of fundamental constants Base and derived unit structure A base quantity is one of a conventionally chosen subset of physical quantities where no quantity in the subset can be expressed in terms of the others A base unit is a unit adopted for expressing a base quantity A derived unit is used for expressing any other quantity and is a product of powers of base units For example in the modern metric system length has the unit metre and time has the unit second and speed has the derived unit metre per second Density or mass per unit volume has the unit kilogram per cubic metre Decimal ratios A characteristic feature of metric systems is their reliance upon multiples of For example the base unit of length is the metre and distances much longer or much shorter than metre are measured in units that are powers of times a metre This is unlike older systems of units in which the ratio between the units for longer and shorter distances varied there are inches in a foot but the number of feet in a mile is not a power of For many everyday applications the United States has resisted the adoption of a decimal based system continuing to use a conglomeration of basically incoherent measurement systems In the early days multipliers that were positive powers of ten were given Greek derived prefixes such as kilo and mega and those that were negative powers of ten were given Latin derived prefixes such as centi and milli However extensions to the prefix system did not follow this convention the prefixes nano and micro for example have Greek roots During the th century the prefix myria derived from the Greek word m rioi was used as a multiplier for When applying prefixes to derived units of area and volume that are expressed in terms of units of length squared or cubed the square and cube operators are applied to the unit of length including the prefix as illustrated below Prefixes are not usually used to indicate multiples of a second greater than the non SI units of minute hour and day are used instead On the other hand prefixes are used for multiples of the non SI unit of volume the litre l L such as millilitres ml Coherence Each variant of the metric system has a degree of coherence the derived units are directly related to the base units without the need for intermediate conversion factors For example in a coherent system the units of force energy and power are chosen so that the equations hold without the introduction of unit conversion factors Once a set of coherent units has been defined other relationships in physics that use this set of units will automatically be true Therefore Einstein s mass energy equation E mc does not require extraneous constants when expressed in coherent units The CGS system had two units of energy the erg that was related to mechanics and the calorie that was related to thermal energy so only one of them the erg could bear a coherent relationship to the base units Coherence was a design aim of SI which resulted in only one unit of energy being defined the joule Rationalisation Maxwell s equations of electromagnetism contained a factor of displaystyle pi relating to steradians representative of the fact that electric charges and magnetic fields may be considered to emanate from a point and propagate equally in all directions i e spherically This factor made equations more awkward than necessary and so Oliver Heaviside suggested adjusting the system of units to remove it Common notions The basic units of the metric system as originally defined represented common quantities or relationships in nature They still do the modern precisely defined quantities are refinements of definition and methodology but still with the same magnitudes In cases where laboratory precision may not be required or available or where approximations are good enough the original definitions may suffice A second is of a minute which is of an hour which is of a day so a second is of a day the use of base dates back to Babylonian times a second is the time it takes a dense object to freely fall metres from rest The length of the equator is close to m more precisely m In fact the dimensions of our planet were used by the French Academy in the original definition of the metre The metre is close to the length of a pendulum that has a period of seconds most dining tabletops are about metres high a very tall human basketball forward is about metres tall The kilogram is the mass of a litre of cold water a cubic centimetre or millilitre of water has a mass of one gram a euro coin weighs g a Sacagawea US dollar coin weighs g a UK pence coin weighs g A candela is about the luminous intensity of a moderately bright candle or candle power a W tungsten filament incandescent light bulb has a luminous intensity of about candelas A mole of a substance has a mass that is its molecular mass expressed in units of grams the mass of a mole of carbon is g and the mass of a mole of table salt is g Since all gases have the same volume per mole at a given temperature and pressure far from their points of liquefaction and solidification see Perfect gas and air is about oxygen molecular mass and nitrogen molecular mass the density of any near perfect gas relative to air can be obtained to a good approximation by dividing its molecular mass by because For example carbon monoxide molecular mass has almost the same density as air A temperature difference of one kelvin is the same as one degree Celsius of the temperature differential between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level the absolute temperature in kelvins is the temperature in degrees Celsius plus about human body temperature is about C or K A W incandescent light bulb rated at V US mains voltage consumes A at this voltage A W bulb rated at V European mains voltage consumes A at this voltage Common metric systems A number of different metric system have been developed all using the M tre des Archives and Kilogramme des Archives or their descendants as their base units but differing in the definitions of the various derived units th century In Gauss used the astronomical second as a base unit in defining the gravitation of the Earth and together with the milligram and millimetre this became the first system of mechanical units He showed that the strength of a magnet could also be quantified in terms of these units by measuring the oscillations of a magnetized needle and finding the quantity of magnetic fluid that produces an acceleration of one unit when applied to a unit mass The centimetre gram second system of units CGS was the first coherent metric system having been developed in the s and promoted by Maxwell and Thomson In this system was formally promoted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science BAAS The system s characteristics are that density is expressed in g cm force expressed in dynes and mechanical energy in ergs Thermal energy was defined in calories one calorie being the energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from C to C The meeting also recognised two sets of units for electrical and magnetic properties the electrostatic set of units and the electromagnetic set of units The CGS units of electricity were cumbersome to work with This was remedied at the International Electrical Congress held in Chicago by defining the international ampere and ohm using definitions based on the metre kilogram and second in the International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units During the same period in which the CGS system was being extended to include electromagnetism other systems were developed distinguished by their choice of coherent base unit including the Practical System of Electric Units or QES quad eleventhgram second system was being used Here the base units are the quad equal to m approximately a quadrant of the Earth s circumference the eleventhgram equal to g and the second These were chosen so that the corresponding electrical units of potential difference current and resistance had a convenient magnitude th century In Giovanni Giorgi showed that by adding an electrical unit as a fourth base unit the various anomalies in electromagnetic systems could be resolved The metre kilogram second coulomb MKSC and metre kilogram second ampere MKSA systems are examples of such systems The metre tonne second system of units MTS was based on the metre tonne and second the unit of force was the sth ne and the unit of pressure was the pi ze It was invented in France for industrial use and from to was used both in France and in the Soviet Union Gravitational metric systems use the kilogram force kilopond as a base unit of force with mass measured in a unit known as the hyl Technische Masseneinheit TME mug or metric slug Although the CGPM passed a resolution in defining the standard value of acceleration due to gravity to be cm s gravitational units are not part of the International System of Units SI International System of Units The International System of Units is the modern metric system It is based on the metre kilogram second ampere MKSA system of units from early in the th century It also includes numerous coherent derived units for common quantities like power watt and irradience lumen Electrical units were taken from the International system then in use Other units like those for energy joule were modelled on those from the older CGS system but scaled to be coherent with MKSA units Two additional base units the kelvin which is equivalent to degree Celsius for change in thermodynamic temperature but set so that K is absolute zero and the candela which is roughly equivalent to the international candle unit of illumination were introduced Later another base unit the mole a unit of amount of substance equivalent to the Avogadro number number of specified molecules was added along with several other derived units The system was promulgated by the General Conference on Weights and Measures French Conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures CGPM in At that time the metre was redefined in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line of the krypton atom krypton being a stable isotope of an inert gas that occurs in undetectable or trace amounts naturally and the standard metre artefact from was retired Today the International system of units consists of base units and innumerable coherent derived units including with special names The last new derived unit the katal for catalytic activity was added in All the base units except the second are now defined in terms of exact and invariant constants of physics or mathematics barring those parts of their definitions which are dependent on the second itself As a consequence the speed of light has now become an exactly defined constant and defines the metre as of the distance light travels in a second The kilogram was defined by a cylinder of platinum iridium alloy until a new definition in terms of natural physical constants was adopted in As of the range of decimal prefixes has been extended to those for quetta and quecto See also Outline of metrology and measurement Notes References External links
