The nanometre international spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures SI symbol nm or nanometer American spelling is a unit of length in the International System of Units SI equal to one billionth short scale of a meter m and to picometres One nanometre can be expressed in scientific notation as m and as m History The nanometre was formerly known as the millimicrometre or more commonly the millimicron for short since it is of a micrometer It was often denoted by the symbol m or more rarely as however should refer to a millionth of a micron Etymology The name combines the SI prefix nano from the Ancient Greek nanos dwarf with the parent unit name metre from Greek metr n unit of measurement Usage Nanotechnologies are based on physical processes which occur on a scale of nanometres see nanoscopic scale The nanometre is often used to express dimensions on an atomic scale the diameter of a helium atom for example is about nm and that of a ribosome is about nm The nanometre is also commonly used to specify the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation near the visible part of the spectrum visible light ranges from around to nm The ngstr m which is equal to nm was formerly used for these purposes Since the late s in usages such as the nm and the nm semiconductor node it has also been used to describe typical feature sizes in successive generations of the ITRS Roadmap for miniaturized semiconductor device fabrication in the semiconductor industry Unicode The CJK Compatibility block in Unicode has the symbol U A SQUARE NM References External links Near field Mie scattering in optical trap nanometry
