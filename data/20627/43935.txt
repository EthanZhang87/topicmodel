id: 43935
A micrometer sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for accurate measurement of components in mechanical engineering and machining as well as most mechanical trades along with other metrological instruments such as dial vernier and digital calipers Micrometers are usually but not always in the form of calipers opposing ends joined by a frame The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil Micrometers are also used in telescopes and microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about by William Gascoigne an English astronomer History The word micrometer is a neoclassical coinage from Greek romanized micros lit small and romanized metron lit measure According to the Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary the word was loaned to English from French with its first known appearance in English writing being in Neither the metre nor the micrometre m nor the micrometer device as we know them today existed at that time However the people of that time did have much need for and interest in the ability to measure small things and small differences The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor even if it did not refer specifically to its present day senses The first ever micrometric screw was invented by William Gascoigne in the th century as an enhancement of the vernier it was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects The London Science Museum contains an exhibit James Watt s end measuring instrument with micrometer screw which the science museum claims is probably the first screw micrometer made This instrument is intended to measure items very accurately by placing them between the two anvils and then advancing one using a fine micrometer screw until both are in contact with the object the distance between them being precisely recorded on the two dials However as the science museum notes there is a possibility that this instrument was not made c by Watt but when it was placed in that year s Special Loan Exhibition of scientific instruments in South Kensington Henry Maudslay built a bench micrometer in the early th century that was jocularly nicknamed the Lord Chancellor among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement accuracy and precision in the firm s work In details of Whitworth s workshop micrometer were published This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders which traversed longitudinally by action of screws The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch His object was to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which while it afforded very accurate indications was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop The first documented development of handheld micrometer screw calipers was by Jean Laurent Palmer of Paris in the device is therefore often called palmer in French tornillo de Palmer Palmer screw in Spanish and calibro Palmer Palmer caliper in Italian Those languages also use the micrometer cognates microm tre micr metro micrometro The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by Brown Sharpe in allowing the penetration of the instrument s use into the average machine shop Brown Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices one of them being Palmer s design In Edward W Morley added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments The culture of toolroom accuracy and precision which started with interchangeability pioneers including Gribeauval Tousard North Hall Whitney and Colt and continued through leaders such as Maudslay Palmer Whitworth Brown Sharpe Pratt Whitney Leland and others grew during the Machine Age to become an important part of combining applied science with technology Beginning in the early th century one could no longer truly master tool and die making machine tool building or engineering without some knowledge of the science of metrology as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics for metallurgy kinematics dynamics and quality Types Specialized types Each type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks For example the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of screw thread in the form of a v block or in the form of a large disc Universal micrometer sets come with interchangeable anvils such as flat spherical spline disk blade point and knife edge The term universal micrometer may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic depth mic step mic etc often known by the brand names Mul T Anvil and Uni Mike Blade micrometers have a matching set of narrow tips blades They allow for example the measuring of a narrow o ring groove Pitch diameter micrometers aka thread mics have a matching set of thread shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads Limit mics have two anvils and two spindles and are used like a snap gauge The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap in order to be within specification The two gaps accurately reflect the top and bottom of the tolerance range Bore micrometer typically a three anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters Tube micrometers have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes Micrometer stops are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine bedways of a lathe or other machine tool in place of simple stops They help the operator to position the table or carriage precisely Stops can also be used to actuate kickout mechanisms or limit switches to halt an automatic feed system Ball micrometers have ball shaped spherical anvils They may have one flat and one ball anvil in which case they are used for measuring tube wall thickness distance of a hole to an edge and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface They differ in application from tube micrometers in that they may be used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single tangential point contact is desired on both sides The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads which is also done with conical anvils or the wire method the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair of balls approach Bench micrometers are tools for inspection use whose accuracy and precision are around half a micrometre millionths of an inch a fifth of a tenth in machinist jargon and whose repeatability is around a quarter micrometre a tenth of a tenth An example is the Pratt Whitney Supermicrometer brand Digit mics are the type with mechanical digits that roll over Digital mics are the type that uses an encoder to detect the distance and displays the result on a digital screen V mics are outside mics with a small V block for an anvil They are useful for measuring the diameter of a circle from three points evenly spaced around it versus the two points of a standard outside micrometer An example of when this is necessary is measuring the diameter of flute endmills and twist drills Operating principles Micrometers use the screw to transform small distances that are too small to measure directly into large rotations of the screw that are big enough to read from a scale The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread forms that are central to the core of its design In some cases it is a differential screw The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement and vice versa through the constant known as the screw s lead li d A screw s lead is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn In most threads that is in all single start threads lead and pitch refer to essentially the same concept With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw a given amount of axial movement will be amplified in the resulting circumferential movement For example if the lead of a screw is mm but the major diameter here outer diameter is mm then the circumference of the screw is or about mm Therefore an axial movement of mm is amplified magnified to a circumferential movement of mm This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer s thimble In some micrometers even greater accuracy is obtained by using a differential screw adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow In classic style analog micrometers the position of the thimble is read directly from scale markings on the thimble and sleeve for names of parts see next section A vernier scale is often included which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark In digital micrometers an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an LCD on the instrument There also exist mechanical digit versions like the style of car odometers where the numbers roll over Parts A micrometer is composed of Reading Micrometers are high precision instruments Proper use of them requires not only understanding their operation itself but also the nature of the object and the dynamic between the instrument and the object as it is being measured For simplicity s sake in the figures and text below issues related to deformation or definition of the length being measured are assumed to be negligible unless otherwise stated Customary Imperial system The spindle of a micrometer graduated for the Imperial and US customary measurement systems has threads per inch so that one turn moves the spindle axially inch equal to the distance between adjacent graduations on the sleeve The graduations on the thimble allow the inch to be further divided so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially inch Thus the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve multiplied by the number of thousandths of an inch that each division represents plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch As the numbers etc appear below every fourth sub division on the sleeve indicating hundreds of thousandths the reading can easily be taken Suppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation and three additional sub divisions were visible on the sleeve as shown in the image and that graduation on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve The reading would then be or inch Metric system The spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has threads per millimetre and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of millimeter The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with millimetre divisions and millimetre subdivisions The thimble has graduations each being millimetre one hundredth of a millimetre Thus the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve As shown in the image suppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation and one additional subdivision were visible on the sleeve The reading from the axial line on the sleeve almost reaches graduation on the thimble The best estimate is graduations The reading then would be exact exact estimate mm estimate As the last digit is an estimated tenth both mm and mm are also reasonably acceptable readings but the former cannot be written as mm or by the rules for significant figures it is then taken to express ten times less precision than the instrument actually has But note that the nature of the object being measured often requires one should round the result to fewer significant figures than which the instrument is capable Vernier micrometers Some micrometers are provided with a vernier scale on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations These permit measurements within millimetre to be made on metric micrometers or inches on inch system micrometers The additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit Thus the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters if any and the number of hundredths of a millimeter as with an ordinary micrometer and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale For example a measurement of millimetres would be obtained by reading millimetres on the sleeve and then adding millimetre as determined by the thimble The vernier would then be used to read the as shown in the image Inch micrometers are read in a similar fashion Note millimeter inch and millimeter inch millionths or alternatively inch millimeters Therefore metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is inch the vernier type has graduations down to inch mm When using either a metric or inch micrometer without a vernier smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations Calibration testing and adjusting Zeroing On most micrometers a small pin spanner is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner s pin This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed Testing A standard one inch micrometer has readout divisions of inch and a rated accuracy of inch one tenth in machinist parlance Both the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement dirt operator skill issue and misuse or abuse of the instrument are the main sources of error The accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure gauge blocks rods or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known If the gauge block is known to be inch seven fifty plus or minus fifty millionths that is seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth then the micrometer should measure it as inch If the micrometer measures inch then it is out of calibration Cleanliness and low but consistent torque are especially important when calibrating each tenth that is ten thousandth of an inch or hundredth of a millimetre counts each is important A mere speck of dirt or a mere bit too much squeeze obscures the truth of whether the instrument can read correctly The solution is simply conscientiousness cleaning patience due care and attention and repeated measurements good repeatability assures the calibrator that their technique is working correctly Calibration typically checks the error at to points along the range Only one can be adjusted to zero If the micrometer is in good condition then they are all so near to zero that the instrument seems to read essentially on all along its range no noticeable error is seen at any locale In contrast on a worn out micrometer or one that was poorly made to begin with one can chase the error up and down the range that is move it up or down to any of various locales along the range by adjusting the sleeve but one cannot eliminate it from all locales at once Calibration can also include the condition of the tips flat and parallel ratchet and linearity of the scale Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat parallel faces which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer s anvil and spindle are against it revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy Commercial machine shops especially those that do certain categories of work military or commercial aerospace nuclear power industry medical and others are required by various standards organizations such as ISO ANSI ASME ASTM SAE AIA the U S military and others to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule often annually to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement Not all calibration is an affair for metrology labs A micrometer can be calibrated on site anytime at least in the most basic and important way if not comprehensively by measuring a high grade gauge block and adjusting to match Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two if they are used daily They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment The accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the international prototype of the meter This bar of metal like the international prototype of the kilogram is maintained under controlled conditions at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures headquarters in France which is one of the principal measurement standards laboratories of the world These master standards have extreme accuracy regional copies kept in the national laboratories of various countries such as NIST and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment Equipment described as NIST traceable means that its comparison against master gauges and their comparison against others can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense which is why NIST traceable equipment is more expensive than non NIST traceable But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost Adjustment A micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible rather repair grinding lapping or replacing of parts is required For standard kinds of instruments in practice it is easier and faster and often no more expensive to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment See also Filar micrometer Vernier scale References Bibliography External links micrometer simulator with zero error Print files including lessons and quizzes for
