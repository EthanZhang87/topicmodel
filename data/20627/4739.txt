The International Bureau of Weights and Measures French Bureau international des poids et mesures BIPM is an intergovernmental organisation through which its member states act on measurement standards in areas including chemistry ionising radiation physical metrology as well as the International System of Units SI and Coordinated Universal Time UTC It is based in Saint Cloud near Paris France The organisation has been referred to as IBWM from its name in English in older literature Structure The BIPM is overseen by the International Committee for Weights and Measures French Comit international des poids et mesures CIPM a committee of eighteen members that meet normally in two sessions per year which is in turn overseen by the General Conference on Weights and Measures French Conf rence g n rale des poids et mesures CGPM that meets in Paris usually once every four years consisting of delegates of the governments of the Member States and observers from the Associates of the CGPM These organs are also commonly referred to by their French initialisms History The BIPM was created on May following the signing of the Metre Convention a treaty among Member States as of November there are now members It is based at the Pavillon de Breteuil in Saint Cloud France a ha acre site originally ha or acres granted to the Bureau by the French Government in Since the site has been considered international territory and the BIPM has all the rights and privileges accorded an intergovernmental organisation This status was further clarified by the French decree No of September Function The BIPM has the mandate to provide the basis for a single coherent system of measurements throughout the world traceable to the International System of Units SI This task takes many forms from direct dissemination of units to coordination through international comparisons of national measurement standards as in electricity and ionising radiation Following consultation a draft version of the BIPM Work Programme is presented at each meeting of the General Conference for consideration with the BIPM budget The final programme of work is determined by the CIPM in accordance with the budget agreed to by the CGPM Currently the BIPM s main work includes Scientific and technical activities carried out in its four departments chemistry ionising radiation physical metrology and time Liaison and coordination work including providing the secretariat for the CIPM Consultative Committees and some of their Working Groups and for the CIPM MRA and providing institutional liaison with the other bodies supporting the international quality infrastructure and other international bodies Capacity building and knowledge transfer programs to increase the effectiveness within the worldwide metrology community of those Member State and Associates with emerging metrology systems A resource centre providing a database and publications for international metrology The BIPM is one of the twelve member organisations of the International Network on Quality Infrastructure INetQI which promotes and implements QI activities in metrology accreditation standardisation and conformity assessment The BIPM has an important role in maintaining accurate worldwide time of day It combines analyses and averages the official atomic time standards of member nations around the world to create a single official Coordinated Universal Time UTC Directors Since its establishment the directors of the BIPM have been See also History of the metre Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements International Organization for Standardization Metrologia National Institute of Standards and Technology Seconds pendulum World Metrology Day Versailles project on advanced materials and standards Notes References External links Media related to International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Wikimedia Commons Official website
