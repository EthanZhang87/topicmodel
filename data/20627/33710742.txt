In physics natural unit systems are measurement systems for which certain physical constants have been set to through nondimensionalization of physical units For example the speed of light c may be set to and it may then be omitted equating mass and energy directly E m rather than using c as a conversion factor in the typical mass energy equivalence equation E mc A purely natural system of units has all of its dimensions collapsed such that the physical constants completely define the system of units and the relevant physical laws contain no conversion constants While natural unit systems simplify the form of each equation it is still necessary to keep track of the non collapsed dimensions of each quantity or expression in order to reinsert physical constants such dimensions uniquely determine the full formula Dimensional analysis in the collapsed system is uninformative as most quantities have the same dimensions Systems of natural units Summary table where is the fine structure constant e c e Gme c p Gmp c A dash indicates where the system is not sufficient to express the quantity Stoney units The Stoney unit system uses the following defining constants c G ke e where c is the speed of light G is the gravitational constant ke is the Coulomb constant and e is the elementary charge George Johnstone Stoney s unit system preceded that of Planck by years He presented the idea in a lecture entitled On the Physical Units of Nature delivered to the British Association in Stoney units did not consider the Planck constant which was discovered only after Stoney s proposal Planck units The Planck unit system uses the following defining constants c G kB where c is the speed of light is the reduced Planck constant G is the gravitational constant and kB is the Boltzmann constant Planck units form a system of natural units that is not defined in terms of properties of any prototype physical object or even elementary particle They only refer to the basic structure of the laws of physics c and G are part of the structure of spacetime in general relativity and is at the foundation of quantum mechanics This makes Planck units particularly convenient and common in theories of quantum gravity including string theory Planck considered only the units based on the universal constants G h c and kB to arrive at natural units for length time mass and temperature but no electromagnetic units The Planck system of units is now understood to use the reduced Planck constant in place of the Planck constant h Schr dinger units The Schr dinger system of units named after Austrian physicist Erwin Schr dinger is seldom mentioned in literature Its defining constants are e G ke Geometrized units Defining constants c G The geometrized unit system used in general relativity the base physical units are chosen so that the speed of light c and the gravitational constant G are set to one Atomic units The atomic unit system uses the following defining constants me e The atomic units were first proposed by Douglas Hartree and are designed to simplify atomic and molecular physics and chemistry especially the hydrogen atom For example in atomic units in the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom an electron in the ground state has orbital radius orbital velocity and so on with particularly simple numeric values Natural units particle and atomic physics This natural unit system used only in the fields of particle and atomic physics uses the following defining constants c me where c is the speed of light me is the electron mass is the reduced Planck constant and is the vacuum permittivity The vacuum permittivity is implicitly used as a nondimensionalization constant as is evident from the physicists expression for the fine structure constant written e which may be compared to the correspoding expression in SI e c Strong units Defining constants c mp Here mp is the proton rest mass Strong units are convenient for work in QCD and nuclear physics where quantum mechanics and relativity are omnipresent and the proton is an object of central interest In this system of units the speed of light changes in inverse proportion to the fine structure constant therefore it has gained some interest recent years in the niche hypothesis of time variation of fundamental constants See also Notes and references External links The NIST website National Institute of Standards and Technology is a convenient source of data on the commonly recognized constants K A Tomilin NATURAL SYSTEMS OF UNITS To the Centenary Anniversary of the Planck System Archived at the Wayback Machine A comparative overview tutorial of various systems of natural units having historical use Pedagogic Aides to Quantum Field Theory Click on the link for Chap to find an extensive simplified introduction to natural units Natural System Of Units In General Relativity PDF by Alan L Myers University of Pennsylvania Equations for conversions from natural to SI units
