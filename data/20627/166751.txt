electron mass ratio In thermodynamics the chemical potential of a system or component of a system Computer science In evolutionary algorithms population size from which in each generation offspring will generate the terms and originate from evolution strategy notation In type theory Used to introduce a recursive data type For example list displaystyle text list tau mu alpha tau alpha is the type of lists with elements of type displaystyle tau a type variable a sum of unit representing nil with a pair of a displaystyle tau and another list displaystyle text list tau represented by displaystyle alpha In this notation displaystyle mu is a binding form where the variable displaystyle alpha introduced by displaystyle mu is bound within the following term displaystyle tau alpha to the term itself Via substitution and arithmetic the type expands to displaystyle tau tau tau cdots an infinite sum of ever increasing products of displaystyle tau that is a list displaystyle tau text list is any k displaystyle k tuple of values of type displaystyle tau for any k displaystyle k geq Another way to express the same type is list list displaystyle text list tau tau text list tau Chemistry In

constant G and the mass M planetary discriminant represents an experimental measure of the actual degree of cleanliness of the orbital zone a criterion for defining a planet The value of is calculated by dividing the mass of the candidate body by the total mass of the other objects that share its orbital zone Music Mu chord Electronic musician Mike Paradinas runs the label Planet Mu which utilizes
