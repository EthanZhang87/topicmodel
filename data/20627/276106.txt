Molar concentration also called molarity amount concentration or substance concentration is a measure of the concentration of a chemical species in particular of a solute in a solution in terms of amount of substance per unit volume of solution In chemistry the most commonly used unit for molarity is the number of moles per liter having the unit symbol mol L or mol dm in SI units A solution with a concentration of mol L is said to be molar commonly designated as M or M Molarity is often depicted with square brackets around the substance of interest for example the molarity of the hydrogen ion is depicted as H Definition Molar concentration or molarity is most commonly expressed in units of moles of solute per litre of solution For use in broader applications it is defined as amount of substance of solute per unit volume of solution or per unit volume available to the species represented by lowercase c displaystyle c c n V N N A V C N A displaystyle c frac n V frac N N text A V frac C N text A Here n displaystyle n is the amount of the solute in moles N displaystyle N is the number of constituent particles present in volume V displaystyle V in litres of the solution and N A displaystyle N text A is the Avogadro constant since defined as exactly mol The ratio N V displaystyle frac N V is the number density C displaystyle C In thermodynamics the use of molar concentration is often not convenient because the volume of most solutions slightly depends on temperature due to thermal expansion This problem is usually resolved by introducing temperature correction factors or by using a temperature independent measure of concentration such as molality The reciprocal quantity represents the dilution volume which can appear in Ostwald s law of dilution Formality or analytical concentration If a molecular entity dissociates in solution the concentration refers to the original chemical formula in solution the molar concentration is sometimes called formal concentration or formality FA or analytical concentration cA For example if a sodium carbonate solution Na CO has a formal concentration of c Na CO mol L the molar concentrations are c Na mol L and c CO mol L because the salt dissociates into these ions Units In the International System of Units SI the coherent unit for molar concentration is mol m However most chemical literature traditionally uses mol dm which is the same as mol L This traditional unit is often called a molar and denoted by the letter M for example mol m mol dm mol L M mM mmol L The SI prefix mega symbol M has the same symbol However the prefix is never used alone so M unambiguously denotes molar Sub multiples such as millimolar mM and nanomolar nM consist of the unit preceded by an SI prefix Related

molar concentrations gives the total molar concentration namely the density of the mixture divided by the molar mass of the mixture or by another name the reciprocal of the molar volume of the mixture In an ionic solution ionic strength is proportional to the sum of the molar concentration of salts Sum of products of molar concentrations and partial molar volumes The sum of products between these quantities equals one i c i V i displaystyle sum i c i overline V i Dependence on volume The molar concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion On small intervals of temperature the dependence is c i c i T T displaystyle c i frac c i T alpha Delta T where c i T displaystyle c i T is the molar concentration at a reference temperature displaystyle alpha is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture Examples See also Molality Orders of magnitude molar concentration References External links Molar Solution Concentration
