In geometry a diameter of a circle is any straight line segment that passes through the centre of the circle and whose endpoints lie on the circle It can also be defined as the longest chord of the circle Both definitions are also valid for the diameter of a sphere In more modern usage the length d displaystyle d of a diameter is also called the diameter In this sense one speaks of the diameter rather than a diameter which refers to the line segment itself because all diameters of a circle or sphere have the same length this being twice the radius r displaystyle r d r or equivalently r d displaystyle d r qquad text or equivalently qquad r frac d For a convex shape in the plane the diameter is defined to be the largest distance that can be formed between two opposite parallel lines tangent to its boundary and the width is often defined to be the smallest such distance Both quantities can be calculated efficiently using rotating calipers For a curve of constant width such as the Reuleaux triangle the width and diameter are the same because all such pairs of parallel tangent lines have the same distance For an ellipse the standard terminology is different A diameter of an ellipse is any chord passing through the centre of the ellipse For example conjugate diameters have the property that a tangent line to the ellipse at the endpoint of one diameter is parallel to the conjugate diameter The longest diameter is called the major axis The word diameter is derived from Ancient Greek diametros diameter of a circle from dia across through and metron measure It is often abbreviated DIA dia d displaystyle text DIA text dia d or displaystyle varnothing Generalizations The definitions given above are only valid for circles spheres and convex shapes However they are special cases of a more general definition that is valid for any kind of n displaystyle n dimensional convex or non convex object such as a hypercube or a set of scattered points The diameter or metric diameter of a subset of a metric space is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the subset Explicitly if S displaystyle S is the subset and if displaystyle rho is the metric the diameter is If the metric displaystyle rho is viewed here as having codomain R displaystyle mathbb R the set of all real numbers this implies that the diameter of the empty set the case S displaystyle S varnothing equals displaystyle infty negative infinity Some authors prefer to treat the empty set as a special case assigning it a diameter of displaystyle which corresponds to taking the codomain of displaystyle rho to be the set of nonnegative reals For any solid object or set of scattered points in n displaystyle n dimensional Euclidean space the diameter of the object or set is the same as the diameter of its convex hull In medical parlance concerning a lesion or in geology concerning a rock the diameter of an object is the least upper bound of the set of all distances between pairs of points in the object In differential geometry the diameter is an important global Riemannian invariant In planar geometry a diameter of a conic section is typically defined as any chord which passes through the conic s centre such diameters are not necessarily of uniform length except in the case of the circle which has eccentricity e displaystyle e Symbol The symbol or variable for diameter is sometimes used in technical drawings or specifications as a prefix or suffix for a number e g mm indicating that it represents diameter Photographic filter thread sizes are often denoted in this way The symbol has a Unicode code point at U DIAMETER SIGN in the Miscellaneous Technical set and should not be confused with several other Unicode characters that resemble it but have unrelated meanings It has the compose sequence Composedi Diameter vs radius The diameter of a circle is exactly twice its radius However this is true only for a circle and only in the Euclidean metric Jung s theorem provides more general inequalities relating the diameter to the radius See also References
