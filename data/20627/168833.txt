Micro Greek letter mu non italic is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of one millionth Confirmed in the prefix comes from the Greek mikr s meaning small It is the only SI prefix which uses a character not from the Latin alphabet In Unicode the symbol is represented by U BC GREEK SMALL LETTER MU or the legacy symbol U B MICRO SIGN The prefix mc is commonly used in healthcare or when the character is not available for example mcg commonly denotes a microgram The letter u is sometimes used instead of when non Latin characters are not available Examples Typical bacteria are to micrometer m in diameter Eukaryotic cells are typically to micrometers in diameter Symbol encoding in character sets The official symbol for the SI prefix micro is a Greek lowercase mu For reasons stemming from its design Unicode has two different character codes for the letter with slightly different appearance in some fonts although most fonts use the same glyph U B MICRO SIGN Alt is in the Latin Supplement range identical to ISO IEC since residing at this code point also in DEC MCS since and ECMA since U BC GREEK SMALL LETTER MU Alt is in the Greek range According to The Unicode Consortium the Greek letter character is preferred but implementations must recognize the micro sign as well for compatibility with legacy character sets This distinction also occurs in some legacy code pages notably Windows In circumstances in which only the Latin alphabet is available ISO since withdrawn DIN since and BS since allow the prefix to be substituted by the letter u or even U if lowercase letters are not available as for example in um for m or uF for F or in the common abbreviation UC for microcontroller C Similarly capacitor values according to the RKM code defined in IEC since can be written as u or U instead of if the Greek letter is not available Other abbreviating conventions In some health care institutions house rules deprecate the standard symbol for microgram g in prescribing or chart recording because of the risk of giving an incorrect dose because of the misreading of poor handwriting The two alternatives are to abbreviate as mcg or to write out microgram in full see also List of abbreviations used in medical prescriptions The alternative abbreviation may be ambiguous in rare circumstances in that mcg could also be read as a micrigram i e g however the prefix micri is not standard nor widely known and is considered obsolete This deprecation focused on avoiding incorrect dosing in contexts where handwriting is often present does not extend to all health care contexts and institutions for example some clinical laboratories reports adhere to it whereas others do not and in physical sciences research g remains the sole official abbreviation In medical data exchange according to the Health Level HL standard the can be replaced by u as well See also Microgram Microscope Microsecond Microwave Square micrometre List of commonly used taxonomic affixes References
