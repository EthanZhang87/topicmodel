The imperial system of units imperial system or imperial units also known as British Imperial or Exchequer Standards of is the system of units first defined in the British Weights and Measures Act Geo c and continued to be developed through a series of Weights and Measures Acts and amendments The imperial system developed from earlier English units as did the related but differing system of customary units of the United States The imperial units replaced the Winchester Standards which were in effect from to The system came into official use across the British Empire in By the late th century most nations of the former empire had officially adopted the metric system as their main system of measurement but imperial units are still used alongside metric units in the United Kingdom and in some other parts of the former empire notably Canada The modern UK legislation defining the imperial system of units is given in the Weights and Measures Act c as amended Implementation The Weights and Measures Act Geo c was initially scheduled to go into effect on May The Weights and Measures Act Geo c pushed back the date to January The act allowed the continued use of pre imperial units provided that they were customary widely known and clearly marked with imperial equivalents Apothecaries units Apothecaries units are not mentioned in the acts of and At the time apothecaries weights and measures were regulated in England Wales and Berwick upon Tweed by the London College of Physicians and in Ireland by the Dublin College of Physicians In Scotland apothecaries units were unofficially regulated by the Edinburgh College of Physicians The three colleges published at infrequent intervals pharmacopoeias the London and Dublin editions having the force of law Imperial apothecaries measures based on the imperial pint of fluid ounces were introduced by the publication of the London Pharmacopoeia of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia of and the Dublin Pharmacopoeia of The Medical Act Vict c transferred to the Crown the right to publish the official pharmacopoeia and to regulate apothecaries weights and measures Units Length Metric equivalents in this article usually assume the latest official definition Before this date the most precise measurement of the imperial Standard Yard was metres Area Volume The Weights and Measures Act Geo c invalidated the various different gallons in use in the British Empire declaring them to be replaced by the statute gallon which became known as the imperial gallon a unit close in volume to the ale gallon The act defined as the volume of a gallon to be that of pounds kg of distilled water weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at inches of mercury kPa at a temperature of F C The act went on to give this volume as cubic inches litres The Weights and Measures Act c refined this definition to be the volume of pounds of distilled water of density g mL weighed in air of density g mL against weights of density g mL which works out to L The Weights and Measures Act c defined a gallon to be exactly L approximately cu in British apothecaries volume measures These measurements were in use from when the new imperial gallon was defined For pharmaceutical purposes they were replaced by the metric system in the United Kingdom on January In the US though no longer recommended the apothecaries system is still used occasionally in medicine especially in prescriptions for older medications Mass and weight In the th and th centuries the UK used three different systems for mass and weight troy weight used for precious metals avoirdupois weight used for most other purposes and apothecaries weight now virtually unused since the metric system is used for all scientific purposes The distinction between mass and weight is not always clearly drawn Strictly a pound is a unit of mass but it is commonly referred to as a weight When a distinction is necessary the term pound force may refer to a unit of force rather than mass The troy pound g was made the primary unit of mass by the Weights and Measures Act Geo c and its use was abolished in the UK on January with only the troy ounce g and its decimal subdivisions retained The Weights and Measures Act Vict c made the avoirdupois pound the primary unit of mass In all the systems the fundamental unit is the pound and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it Natural equivalents The Act of Parliament defined the yard and pound by reference to the prototype standards and it also defined the values of certain physical constants to make provision for re creation of the standards if they were to be damaged For the yard the length of a pendulum beating seconds at the latitude of Greenwich at Mean Sea Level in vacuo was defined as inches For the pound the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an atmospheric pressure of inches of mercury and a temperature of Fahrenheit was defined as grains with there being grains per pound Following the destruction of the original prototypes in the Houses of Parliament fire it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions and a new Weights and Measures Act Vict c was passed which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized secondary standards Current use United Kingdom Since the Weights and Measures Act British law defines base imperial units in terms of their metric equivalent The metric system is routinely used in business and technology within the United Kingdom with imperial units remaining in widespread use amongst the public All UK roads use the imperial system except for weight limits and newer height or width restriction signs give metric alongside imperial Traders in the UK may accept requests from customers specified in imperial units and scales which display in both unit systems are commonplace in the retail trade Metric price signs may be accompanied by imperial price signs provided that the imperial signs are no larger and no more prominent than the metric ones The United Kingdom completed its official partial transition to the metric system in with imperial units still legally mandated for certain applications such as draught beer and cider and road signs Therefore the speedometers on vehicles sold in the UK must be capable of displaying miles per hour Even though the troy pound was outlawed in the UK in the Weights and Measures Act the troy ounce may still be used for the weights of precious stones and metals The original railways many built in the Victorian era are a big user of imperial units with distances officially measured in miles and yards or miles and chains and also feet and inches and speeds are in miles per hour Some British people still use one or more imperial units in everyday life for distance miles yards feet and inches and some types of volume measurement especially milk and beer in pints rarely for canned or bottled soft drinks or petrol As of February many British people also still use imperial units in everyday life for body weight stones and pounds for adults pounds and ounces for babies Government documents aimed at the public may give body weight and height in imperial units as well as in metric A survey in found that many people did not know their body weight or height in both systems People under the age of preferred the metric system but people aged and over preferred the imperial system As in other English speaking countries including Australia Canada and the United States the height of horses is usually measured in hands standardised to inches mm Fuel consumption for vehicles is commonly stated in miles per gallon mpg though official figures always include litres per km equivalents and fuel is sold in litres When sold draught in licensed premises beer and cider must be sold in pints half pints or third pints Cow s milk is available in both litre and pint based containers in supermarkets and shops Areas of land associated with farming forestry and real estate are commonly advertised in acres and square feet but for contracts and land registration purposes the units are always hectares and square metres Office space and industrial units are usually advertised in square feet Steel pipe sizes are sold in increments of inches while copper pipe is sold in increments of millimetres Road bicycles have their frames measured in centimetres while off road bicycles have their frames measured in inches Display sizes for screens on television sets and computer monitors are always diagonally measured in inches Food sold by length or width e g pizzas or sandwiches is generally sold in inches Clothing is usually sized in inches with the metric equivalent often shown as a small supplementary indicator Gas is usually measured by the cubic foot or cubic metre but is billed like electricity by the kilowatt hour Pre packaged products can show both metric and imperial measures and it is also common to see imperial pack sizes with metric only labels e g a lb g tin of Lyle s Golden Syrup is always labelled g with no imperial indicator Similarly most jars of jam and packs of sausages are labelled g with no imperial indicator India India began converting to the metric system from the imperial system between and The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the Indian Parliament in December with the Standards of Weights and Measures Act which took effect beginning October By metric units became mandatory and exclusive Today all official measurements are made in the metric system In common usage some older Indians may still refer to imperial units Some measurements such as the heights of mountains are still recorded in feet Tyre rim diameters are still measured in inches as used worldwide Industries like the construction and the real estate industry still use both the metric and the imperial system though it is more common for sizes of homes to be given in square feet and land in acres In Standard Indian English as in Australian Canadian New Zealand Singaporean and British English metric units such as the litre metre and tonne utilise the traditional spellings brought over from French which differ from those used in the United States and the Philippines The imperial long ton is invariably spelt with one n Hong Kong Hong Kong has three main systems of units of measurement in current use The Chinese units of measurement of the Qing Empire no longer in widespread use in China British imperial units and The metric system In the Hong Kong Government started the conversion to the metric system and as of measurements for government purposes such as road signs are almost always in metric units All three systems are officially permitted for trade and in the wider society a mixture of all three systems prevails The Chinese system s most commonly used units for length are lei zoeng cek cyun fan in descending scale order These units are now rarely used in daily life the imperial and metric systems being preferred The imperial equivalents are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems the units can be prefixed with Ying jing for the imperial system and Wa waa for the Chinese system In writing derived characters are often used with an additional mouth radical to the left of the original Chinese character for writing imperial units The most commonly used units are the mile or li li the yard or ma maa the foot or chek cek and the inch or tsun cyun The traditional measure of flat area is the square foot fong cek ping fong cek of the imperial system which is still in common use for real estate purposes The measurement of agricultural plots and fields is traditionally conducted in mau of the Chinese system For the measurement of volume Hong Kong officially uses the metric system though the gallon gaa leon is also occasionally used Canada During the s the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system Within the government efforts to implement the metric system were extensive almost any agency institution or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively Imperial units were eliminated from all public road signs and both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs such as the height warnings at the entrance of a parkade In the s momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of Brian Mulroney was elected There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well The law requires that measured products such as fuel and meat be priced in metric units and an imperial price can be shown if a metric price is present There tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only Environment Canada still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media Some radio stations near the United States border such as CIMX and CIDR primarily use imperial units to report the weather Railways in Canada also continue to use imperial units Imperial units are still used in ordinary conversation Today Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives The use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age The older generation mostly uses the imperial system while the younger generation more often uses the metric system Quebec has implemented metrication more fully Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units Drivers licences use SI units though many English speaking Canadians give their height and weight in imperial In livestock auction markets cattle are sold in dollars per hundredweight short whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms Imperial units still dominate in recipes construction house renovation and gardening Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units whilst initial surveys used imperial units For example partitioning of farmland on the prairies in the late th and early th centuries was done in imperial units this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the Prairie Provinces In English speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly but not exclusively constructed using square feet while in French speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both square metres and square feet as equivalents Carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot but less frequently also in square metres Motor vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per km and statute miles per imperial gallon leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are more fuel efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon neither country specifies which gallon is used Canadian railways maintain exclusive use of imperial measurements to describe train length feet train height feet capacity tons speed mph and trackage miles Imperial units also retain common use in firearms and ammunition Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention e g Ruger HMR where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch Ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric e g mm In the manufacture of ammunition bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of grains for both metric and imperial cartridges In keeping with the international standard air navigation is based on nautical units e g the nautical mile which is neither imperial nor metric and altitude is measured in imperial feet Australia While metrication in Australia has largely ended the official use of imperial units for particular measurements international use of imperial units is still followed In licensed venues draught beer and cider is sold in glasses and jugs with sizes based on the imperial fluid ounce though rounded to the nearest mL Newborns are measured in metric at hospitals but the birth weight and length is sometimes also announced to family and friends in imperial units Screen sizes are frequently advertised in inches instead of or as well as centimetres Property size is frequently advertised in acres but is mostly as square metres Navigation is done in nautical miles and water based speed limits are in nautical miles per hour Historical writing and presentations may include pre metric units to reflect the context of the era represented The illicit drug trade in Australia still often uses imperial measurements particularly when dealing with smaller amounts closer to end user levels e g ball an th of an ounce or g cannabis is often traded in ounces oz and pounds p Firearm barrel length are almost always referred by in inches ammunition is also still measured in grains and ounces as well as grams As a result of cultural transmission of British and American English in Australia there has also been noted to be a cause for residual use of imperial units of measure New Zealand New Zealand introduced the metric system on December Aviation was exempt with altitude and airport elevation continuing to be measured in feet whilst navigation is done in nautical miles all other aspects fuel quantity aircraft weight runway length etc use metric units Screen sizes for devices such as televisions monitors and phones and wheel rim sizes for vehicles are stated in inches as is the convention in the rest of the world and a study found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units Ireland Ireland has officially changed over to the metric system since entering the European Union with distances on new road signs being metric since and speed limits being metric since The imperial system remains in limited use for sales of beer in pubs traditionally sold by the pint All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units with traditional quantities being retained for goods like butter and sausages which are sold in grams lb packaging The majority of cars sold pre feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit but with a kilometres per hour display Often signs such as those for bridge height can display both metric and imperial units Imperial measurements continue to be used colloquially by the general population especially with height and distance measurements such as feet inches and acres as well as for weight with pounds and stones still in common use among people of all ages Measurements such as yards have fallen out of favour with younger generations Ireland s railways still use imperial measurements for distances and speed signage Property is usually listed in square feet as well as metres also Horse racing in Ireland still continues to use stones pounds miles and furlongs as measurements Bahamas Imperial measurements remain in general use in the Bahamas Legally both the imperial and metric systems are recognised by the Weights and Measures Act Belize Both imperial units and metric units are used in Belize Both systems are legally recognized by the National Metrology Act Myanmar According to the CIA in June Myanmar was one of three countries that had not adopted the SI metric system as their official system of weights and measures Metrication efforts began in The Burmese government set a goal to metricate by which was not met with the help of the German National Metrology Institute Other countries Some imperial measurements remain in limited use in Malaysia the Philippines Sri Lanka and South Africa Measurements in feet and inches especially for a person s height are frequently encountered in conversation and non governmental publications Prior to metrication it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were from the nearest major town In some cases these eventually became the official names of the locations in other cases such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names An example of the former is Batu literally Mile in Malay which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between Federal Route the Tamparuli Sandakan highway and Federal Route the Sandakan Tawau highway The area is so named because it is miles west of Sandakan the nearest major town Petrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in Anguilla Antigua and Barbuda Belize Myanmar the Cayman Islands Dominica Grenada Montserrat St Kitts and Nevis and St Vincent and the Grenadines The United Arab Emirates Cabinet in issued the Decree No specifying that from January the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon which was in line with the UAE Cabinet Decision No of on the national system of measurement which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May In October the Antigua and Barbuda government announced the re launch of the Metrication Programme in accordance with the Metrology Act which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units The Antigua and Barbuda government has committed to a full conversion from the imperial system by the first quarter of See also Explanatory notes Citations General sources Appendices B and C of NIST Handbook Thompson A Taylor Barry N October The NIST guide for the use of the
