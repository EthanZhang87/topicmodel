ISO IEC Information technology bit single byte coded graphic character sets Part Latin alphabet No is part of the ISO IEC series of ASCII based standard character encodings first edition published in ISO IEC encodes what it refers to as Latin alphabet no consisting of characters from the Latin script This character encoding scheme is used throughout the Americas Western Europe Oceania and much of Africa It is the basis for some popular bit character sets and the first two blocks of characters in Unicode ISO was according to the standard at least the default encoding of documents delivered via HTTP with a MIME type beginning with text As of April of all and of the top web sites use ISO IEC It is the most declared single byte character encoding but as Web browsers and the HTML standard interpret them as the superset Windows these documents may include characters from that set Depending on the country or language use on websites at least can be much higher than the global average e g including Windows for Brazil according to website use use is at and in Germany at ISO was the default encoding of the values of certain descriptive HTTP headers and defined the repertoire of characters allowed in HTML documents and is specified by many other standards It s rarely assumed to be the encoding of text in operating systems while it was very common in the past though if an bit encoding is used then its superset encoding Windows is most likely to be used on Microsoft Windows if there is no byte order mark BOM this is only gradually being changed to UTF ISO is the IANA preferred name for this standard when supplemented with the C and C control codes from ISO IEC The following other aliases are registered iso ir csISOLatin latin l IBM Code page a k a Windows is used for it in Windows IBM calls it code page or CP CCSID Oracle calls it WE ISO P Coverage Each character is encoded as a single eight bit code value These code values can be used in almost any data interchange system to communicate in the following languages while it may exclude correct quotation marks such as for many languages including German and Icelandic Modern languages with complete coverage Notes Languages with incomplete coverage ISO was commonly used for certain languages even though it lacks characters used by these languages In most cases only a few letters are missing or they are rarely used and they can be replaced with characters that are in ISO using some form of typographic approximation The following table lists such languages The letter which appears in French only very rarely mainly in city names such as L Ha les Roses and never at the beginning of words is included only in lowercase form The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter from the German language which did not have an uppercase form at the time when the standard was created Quotation marks For some languages listed above the correct typographical quotation marks are missing as only and are included Also this scheme does not provide for oriented or shaped single or double quotation marks Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent x and the apostrophe x as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks see Quotation mark Typewriters and early computers but this is not considered part of the modern standard History ISO was based on the Multinational Character Set MCS used by Digital Equipment Corporation DEC in the popular VT terminal in It was developed within the European Computer Manufacturers Association ECMA and published in March as ECMA by which name it is still sometimes known The second edition of ECMA June also included ISO ISO and ISO as part of the specification The original draft of ISO placed French and at code points xD and xF as in the MCS However the delegate from France being neither a linguist nor a typographer falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own but mere ligatures like or supported by the delegate team from Bull Publishing Company who regularly did not print French with in their house style at the time An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted on retaining but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull These code points were soon filled with and under the suggestion of the German delegation Support for French was further reduced when it was again falsely stated that the letter is not French resulting in the absence of the capital In fact the letter is found in a number of French proper names and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias These characters were added to ISO IEC BraSCII matches the original draft In Commodore adopted ECMA for its new AmigaOS operating system The Seikosha MP AI impact dot matrix printer used with the Amiga included this encoding In the first version of Unicode used the code points of ISO as the first Unicode code points In the IANA registered the character map ISO more commonly known by its preferred MIME name of ISO note the extra hyphen over ISO a superset of ISO for use on the Internet This map assigns the C and C control codes to the unassigned code values thus provides for characters via every possible bit value Code page layout Similar character sets ISO IEC ISO IEC was developed in as an update of ISO IEC It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the euro sign which are missing from ISO IEC This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO IEC including fraction symbols and letter free diacritics and Ironically three of the newly added characters and had already been present in DEC s Multinational Character Set MCS the predecessor to ISO IEC Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes the characters had to be reintroduced under different less logical code points ISO IR a more minor modification called code page by FreeDOS had been registered in altering ISO by replacing the universal currency sign with the euro sign the same substitution made by ISO Windows The popular Windows character set adds all the missing characters provided by ISO IEC plus a number of typographic symbols by replacing the rarely used C controls in the range to hex to F It is very common to mislabel Windows text as being in ISO A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes produced by smart quotes in word processing software were replaced with question marks or boxes on non Windows operating systems making text difficult to read Many Web browsers and e mail clients will interpret ISO control codes as Windows characters and that behavior was later standardized in HTML Mac Roman The Apple Macintosh computer introduced a character encoding called Mac Roman in It was meant to be suitable for Western European desktop publishing It is a superset of ASCII and has most of the characters that are in ISO and all the extra characters from Windows but in a totally different arrangement The few printable characters that are in ISO IEC but not in this set are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers including the last version of Internet Explorer for Mac Other DOS has code page which has all printable characters that ISO has albeit in a totally different arrangement plus the most widely used graphic characters from code page Between and Hewlett Packard used another superset of ISO on many of their calculators This proprietary character set was sometimes referred to simply as ECMA as well HP also has code page which adds the medium shade U at x F Several EBCDIC code pages were purposely designed to have the same set of characters as ISO to allow easy conversion between them See also Latin
