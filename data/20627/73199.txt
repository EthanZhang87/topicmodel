After a November Inland Revenue hearing CUP s application was refused on the ground that since the Press was printing and publishing for the outside world and not simply for the internal use of the University the Press s trade went beyond the purpose and objects of the University and in terms of the Act was not exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the University In November with CUP facing financial collapse CUP s chief executive Geoffrey Cass wrote a page preliminary letter to the Inland Revenue again seeking tax exemption A year later Cass s application was granted in a letter from the Inland Revenue though the decision was not made public After consulting CUP Cambridge s sister press the giant Oxford University Press presented their own submission and received similar exemption In OUP s tax exemption was publicly attacked by Joel Rickett of The Bookseller in The Guardian In with the new public benefit requirement of the revised

article on the subject Alms for Jihad In controversy arose over the press s decision to destroy all remaining copies of its book Alms for Jihad Charity and Terrorism in the Islamic World by Burr and Collins as part of the settlement of a lawsuit brought by Saudi billionaire Khalid bin Mahfouz Within hours Alms for Jihad became one of the most sought after titles on Amazon com and eBay in the United States The press sent a letter to libraries asking them to remove copies from circulation The press subsequently sent out copies of an errata sheet for the book The American Library Association issued a recommendation to libraries still holding Alms for Jihad Given the intense interest in the book and the desire of readers to learn about the controversy first hand we recommend that U S libraries keep the book available for their users The publisher s decision did not have the support of the book s authors and was criticized by some who claimed it was incompatible with freedom of speech and with freedom of the press and that it indicated that English defamation laws were excessively strict In the New York Times Book Review October United States Congressman Frank R Wolf described Cambridge s settlement as basically a book burning The press pointed out that at that time it had already sold most of its copies of the book The press defended its actions saying it had acted responsibly and that it is a global publisher with a duty to observe the laws of many different countries Cambridge University Press v Patton In this case originally filed in CUP et al accused
