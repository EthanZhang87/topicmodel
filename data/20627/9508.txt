The Encyclop dia Britannica Latin for British Encyclop dia is a general knowledge English language encyclopaedia It has been published by Encyclop dia Britannica Inc since although the company has changed ownership seven times The encyclopaedia is maintained by about full time editors and more than contributors The version of the th edition which spans volumes and pages was the last printed edition Since it has been published exclusively as an online encyclopaedia Printed for years the Britannica was the longest running in print encyclopaedia in the English language It was first published between and in the Scottish capital of Edinburgh in three volumes The encyclopaedia grew in size the second edition was volumes and by its fourth edition it had expanded to volumes Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors and the th and th editions are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style Starting with the th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm the Britannica shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market In the Britannica became the first encyclopaedia to adopt continuous revision in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted with every article updated on a schedule In the st century the Britannica suffered first from competition with the digital multimedia encyclopaedia Microsoft Encarta and later with the online peer produced encyclopaedia Wikipedia In March it announced it would no longer publish printed editions and would focus instead on the online version Britannica has been assessed to be politically closer to the centre of the US political spectrum than Wikipedia The th edition has a three part structure a volume Microp dia of short articles generally fewer than words a volume Macrop dia of long articles two to pages and a single Prop dia volume to give a hierarchical outline of knowledge The Microp dia was meant for quick fact checking and as a guide to the Macrop dia readers are advised to study the Prop dia outline to understand a subject s context and to find more detailed articles Over years the size of the Britannica has remained steady with about million words on half a million topics Though published in the United States since the Britannica has for the most part maintained British English spelling Present status Print version From the Britannica consisted of four parts the Microp dia the Macrop dia the Prop dia and a two volume index The Britannica s articles are contained in the Micro and Macrop dia which encompass and volumes respectively each volume having roughly one thousand pages The Macrop dia has in depth articles ranging in length from two pages to pages with references and named contributors In contrast the Microp dia has roughly articles the vast majority about of which contain fewer than words no references and no named contributors The Microp dia articles are intended for quick fact checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the Macrop dia The Macrop dia articles are meant as authoritative well written commentaries on their subjects as well as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere The longest article pages is on the subject of the United States and it resulted from merging separate articles on the individual US states A Global Edition of Britannica contained approximately articles Information can be found in the Britannica by following the cross references in the Microp dia and Macrop dia these are sparse however averaging one cross reference per page Readers are instead recommended to consult the alphabetical index or the Prop dia which organizes the Britannica s contents by topic The core of the Prop dia is its Outline of Knowledge which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge Accordingly the Outline is consulted by the Britannica s editors to decide which articles should be included in the Micro and Macrop dia The Outline can also be used as a study guide as it puts subjects in their proper perspective and suggests a series of Britannica articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth However libraries have found that it is scarcely used for this purpose and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopaedia The Prop dia contains color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members advisors and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica Taken together the Microp dia and Macrop dia comprise roughly million words and images The two volume index has pages listing the topics covered in the Britannica together with subentries under those topics The Britannica generally prefers British spelling over American for example it uses colour not color centre not center and encyclopaedia not encyclopedia There are some exceptions to this rule such as defense rather than defence Common alternative spellings are provided with cross references such as Color see Colour Since the Britannica has been revised on a regular schedule with at least of the articles considered for revision each year According to one Britannica website of the articles in the edition were revised over the preceding three years however according to another Britannica website only of the articles were revised over the same period The alphabetization of articles in the Microp dia and Macrop dia follows strict rules Diacritical marks and non English letters are ignored while numerical entries such as War of are alphabetized as if the number had been written out Eighteen twelve War of Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons then by places then by things Rulers with identical names are organized first alphabetically by country and then by chronology thus Charles III of France precedes Charles I of England listed in Britannica as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland That is they are alphabetized as if their titles were Charles France and Charles Great Britain and Ireland Similarly places that share names are organized alphabetically by country then by ever smaller political divisions In March the company announced that the edition would be the last printed version This was part of a move by the company to adapt to the times and focus on its future using digital distribution The peak year for the printed encyclopaedia was when sets were sold but sales had dropped to per annum by There were sets of the edition printed of which had been sold by March By late April the remaining copies of the edition had sold out at Britannica s online store As of a replica of Britannica s first edition is available via the online store Related printed material Britannica

code review issue Personnel and management Contributors The print version of the Britannica has contributors many eminent in their fields such as Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman astronomer Carl Sagan and surgeon Michael DeBakey Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased some as long ago as Alfred North Whitehead while another quarter are retired or emeritus Most approximately contribute to only a single article however contributed to three articles contributed to four articles contributed to five articles and contributed to more than five articles An exceptionally prolific contributor is Christine Sutton of the University of Oxford who contributed articles on particle physics While Britannica s authors have included writers such as Albert Einstein Marie Curie and Leon Trotsky as well as notable independent encyclopaedists such as Isaac Asimov some have been criticized for lack of expertise In the historian George L Burr wrote With a temerity almost appalling the Britannica contributor Mr Philips ranges over nearly the whole field of European history political social ecclesiastical The grievance is that this work lacks authority This too this reliance on editorial energy instead of on ripe special learning may alas be also counted an Americanizing for certainly nothing has so cheapened the scholarship of our American encyclopaedias Staff As of in the th edition of Britannica Dale Hoiberg a sinologist was listed as Britannica s Senior Vice President and editor in chief Among his predecessors as editors in chief were Hugh Chisholm James Louis Garvin Franklin Henry Hooper Walter Yust Harry Ashmore Warren E Preece Sir William Haley Philip W Goetz and Robert McHenry As of Anita Wolff was listed as the Deputy Editor and Theodore Pappas as Executive Editor Prior Executive Editors include John V Dodge and Philip W Goetz Paul T Armstrong remains the longest working employee of Encyclop dia Britannica He began his career there in eventually earning

Associate Editors supervised by Dale Hoiberg and four others The editorial staff helped to write the articles of the Microp dia and some sections of the Macrop dia Editorial advisors The Britannica has an editorial board of advisors which includes distinguished scholars non fiction author Nicholas Carr religion scholar Wendy Doniger political economist Benjamin M Friedman Council on Foreign Relations President Emeritus Leslie H Gelb computer scientist David Gelernter Physics Nobel laureate Murray Gell Mann Carnegie Corporation of New York President Vartan Gregorian philosopher Thomas Nagel cognitive scientist Donald Norman musicologist Don Michael Randel Stewart Sutherland Baron Sutherland of Houndwood President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and cultural anthropologist Michael

the Outline s chief architects Rene Dubos d Loren Eiseley d Harold D Lasswell d Mark Van Doren d Peter Ritchie Calder d and Mortimer J Adler d The Prop dia also lists just under advisors who were consulted for the unsigned Microp dia articles Corporate structure In January the Britannica was purchased from the Benton Foundation by billionaire Swiss financier Jacqui Safra who serves as its current chair of the board In Don Yannias a long time associate and investment advisor of Safra became CEO of Encyclop dia Britannica Incorporated In a new company Britannica com Incorporated was created to develop digital versions of the Britannica Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company while his former position at the parent company remained vacant for two years Yannias tenure at Britannica com Incorporated was marked by missteps considerable lay offs and financial losses In Yannias was replaced by Ilan Yeshua who reunited the leadership of the two companies Yannias later returned to investment management but remains on the Britannica s Board of Directors In former management consultant Jorge Aguilar Cauz was appointed President of Encyclop dia Britannica Incorporated Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the Britannica s Board of Directors Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the Britannica brand to new educational and reference products continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO Elkan Harrison Powell in the mid s In the fall of Karthik Krishnan was appointed global chief executive officer of the Encyclop dia Britannica Group Krishnan brought a varied perspective to the role based on several high level positions in digital media including RELX formerly known as Reed Elsevier and one of the constituents of the FTSE Index and Rodale in which he was responsible for driving business and cultural transformation and accelerating growth Taking the reins of the company as it was preparing to mark its th anniversary and define the next phase of its digital strategy for consumers and K schools Krishnan launched a series of new initiatives in his first year First was Britannica Insights a free downloadable software extension to the Google Chrome browser that served up edited fact checked Britannica information with queries on search engines such as Google Yahoo and Bing Its purpose the company said was to provide trusted verified information in conjunction with search results that were thought to be increasingly unreliable in the era of misinformation and fake news The product was quickly followed by Britannica School Insights which provided similar content for subscribers to Britannica s online classroom solutions and a partnership with YouTube in which verified Britannica content appeared on the site as an antidote to user generated video content that could be false or misleading Krishnan an educator at New York University s Stern School of Business believes in the transformative power of education and set steering the company toward solidifying its place among leaders in educational technology and supplemental curriculum Krishnan aimed at providing more useful and relevant solutions to customer needs extending and renewing Britannica s historical emphasis on utility which had been the watchword of its first edition in Competition As the Britannica is a general encyclopaedia it does not seek to compete with specialized encyclopaedias such as the Encyclopaedia of Mathematics or the Dictionary of the Middle Ages which can devote much more space to their chosen topics In its first years the Britannica s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of Ephraim Chambers and soon thereafter Rees s Cyclop dia and Coleridge s Encyclop dia Metropolitana In the th century successful competitors included Collier s Encyclopedia the Encyclopedia Americana and the World Book Encyclopedia Nevertheless from the th edition onwards the Britannica was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors The print version of the Britannica was significantly more expensive than its competitors Since the early s the Britannica has faced new challenges from digital information sources The Internet facilitated by the development of Web search engines has grown into a common source of information for many people and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions thanks in part to initiatives such as Google Books MIT s release of its educational materials and the open PubMed Central library of the National Library of Medicine The Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated In rapidly changing fields such as science technology politics culture and modern history the Britannica has struggled to stay up to date a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor Walter Yust Eventually the Britannica turned to focus more on its online edition Print encyclopaedias The Encyclop dia Britannica has been compared with other print encyclopaedias both qualitatively and quantitatively A well known comparison is that of Kenneth Kister who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the Britannica with two comparable encyclopaedias Collier s Encyclopedia and the Encyclopedia Americana For the quantitative analysis ten articles were selected at random circumcision Charles Drew Galileo Philip Glass heart disease IQ panda bear sexual harassment Shroud of Turin and Uzbekistan and letter grades of A D or F were awarded in four categories coverage accuracy clarity and recency In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias the four average grades fell between B and B chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in In the accuracy category the Britannica received one D and seven A s Encyclopedia Americana received eight A s and Collier s received one D and seven A s thus Britannica received an average score of for accuracy to Americana s and Collier s In the timeliness category Britannica averaged an to Americana s and Collier s In the President of Encyclop dia Britannica announced that after years the encyclopaedia would cease print production and all future editions would be entirely digital Digital encyclopaedias on optical media The most notable competitor of the Britannica among CD DVD ROM digital encyclopaedias was Encarta now discontinued a modern multimedia encyclopaedia that incorporated three print encyclopaedias Funk Wagnalls Collier s and the New Merit Scholar s Encyclopedia Encarta was the top selling multimedia encyclopaedia based on total US retail sales from January to February Both occupied the same price range with the Encyclop dia Britannica Ultimate CD or DVD costing US and the Microsoft Encarta Premium DVD costing US The Britannica disc contains articles and Merriam Webster s Dictionary and Thesaurus US only and offers Primary and Secondary School editions Encarta contained articles a user friendly Visual Browser interactive maps math language and homework tools a US and UK dictionary and a youth edition Like Encarta the digital Britannica has been criticized for being biased towards United States audiences the United Kingdom related articles are updated less often maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries and it lacks a UK dictionary Like the Britannica Encarta was available online by subscription although some content could be accessed free Wikipedia The main online alternative to Britannica is Wikipedia The key differences between the two lie in accessibility the model of participation they bring to an encyclopedic project their respective style sheets and editorial policies relative ages the number of subjects treated the number of languages in which articles are written and made available and their underlying economic models unlike Britannica Wikipedia is a not for profit does not carry advertising on its site and is not connected with traditional profit and contract based publishing distribution networks Britannica s articles either have known authorship or a set of possible authors the editorial staff With the exception of the editorial staff most of Britannica s contributors are experts in their field some are Nobel laureates By contrast the articles of Wikipedia are written by people of unknown degrees of expertise most do not claim any particular expertise and of those who do many are anonymous and have no verifiable credentials It is for this lack of institutional vetting or certification that former Britannica editor in chief Robert McHenry noted his belief in that Wikipedia could not hope to rival the Britannica in accuracy In the journal Nature chose articles from both websites in a wide range of science topics and sent them to what it called relevant field experts for peer review The experts then compared the competing articles one from each site on a given topic side by side but were not told which article came from which site Nature got back usable reviews The journal found just eight serious errors such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts four from each site It also discovered many factual errors omissions or misleading statements in Wikipedia and in Britannica an average of mistakes per article for Wikipedia and for Britannica Although Britannica was revealed as the more accurate encyclopaedia with fewer errors in its rebuttal called Nature s study flawed and misleading and called for a prompt retraction It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a Britannica yearbook and not the encyclopaedia and another two were from Compton s Encyclopedia called the Britannica Student Encyclopedia on the company s website Nature defended its story and declined to retract stating that as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica s website Interviewed in February the managing director of Britannica UK said Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there but their approach wouldn t work for Encyclop dia Britannica My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind They re a chisel we re a drill and you need to have the correct tool for the job For the th anniversary of Wikipedia the Telegraph published two opinion pieces which compared Wikipedia to Britannica and falsely claimed that Britannica had gone bankrupt in In a January press release Britannica responded by calling Wikipedia an impressive achievement but argued that critics should avoid false comparisons to Britannica in terms of differing models and purposes Critical and popular assessments Reputation Since the rd edition the Britannica has enjoyed a popular and critical reputation for general excellence The rd and th editions were pirated for sale in the United States beginning with Dobson s Encyclop dia On the release of the th edition Time magazine dubbed the Britannica the Patriarch of the Library In a related advertisement naturalist William Beebe was quoted as saying that the Britannica was beyond comparison because there is no competitor References to the Britannica can be found throughout English literature most notably in one of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle s favourite Sherlock Holmes stories The Red Headed League The tale was highlighted by the Lord Mayor of London Gilbert Inglefield at the bicentennial of the Britannica The Britannica has a reputation for summarizing knowledge To further their education some people have devoted themselves to reading the entire Britannica taking anywhere from three to years to do so When Fat h Ali became the Shah of Persia in he was given a set of the Britannica s rd edition after reading the complete set he extended his royal title to include Most Formidable Lord and Master of the Encyclop dia Britannica Writer George Bernard Shaw claimed to have read the complete th edition except for the science articles Richard Evelyn Byrd took the Britannica as reading material for his five month stay at the South Pole in and Philip Beaver read it during a sailing expedition More recently A J Jacobs an editor at Esquire magazine read the entire version of the th edition describing his experiences in the well received book The Know It All One Man s Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World Only two people are known to have read two independent editions the author C S Forester and Amos Urban Shirk an American businessman who read the th and th editions devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the th Awards The CD DVD ROM version of the Britannica Encyclop dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite received the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Association of Educational Publishers On July Encyclop dia Britannica was awarded a spot as one of Top Ten Superbrands in the UK by a panel of more than independent reviewers as reported by the BBC Coverage of topics Topics are chosen in part by reference to the Prop dia Outline of Knowledge The bulk of the Britannica is devoted to geography of the Macrop dia biography biology and medicine literature physics and astronomy religion art Western philosophy and law A complementary study of the Microp dia found that geography accounted for of articles science social sciences biography and all other humanities Writing in one reviewer judged that the range depth and catholicity of coverage of the Britannica are unsurpassed by any other general Encyclopaedia The Britannica does not cover topics in equal detail for example the whole of Buddhism and most other religions is covered in a single Macrop dia article whereas articles are devoted to Christianity comprising nearly half of all religion articles The Britannica covers biographies of them about women with being British citizens and US citizens However the Britannica has been lauded as the least biased of general Encyclopaedias marketed to Western readers and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras It can be stated without fear of contradiction that the th edition of the Britannica accords non Western cultural social and scientific developments more notice than any general English language encyclopedia currently on the market Criticism of editorial decisions On rare occasions the Britannica has been criticized for its editorial choices Given its roughly constant size the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others resulting in controversial decisions The initial th edition was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of children s literature military decorations and the French poet Joachim du Bellay editorial mistakes were also alleged such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies Its elimination of the index was condemned as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the Microp dia and Macrop dia Summing up one critic called the initial th edition a qualified failure that cares more for juggling its format than for preserving More recently reviewers from the American Library Association were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the Macrop dia along with the article on psychology Some very few Britannica appointed contributors are mistaken A notorious instance from the Britannica s early years is the rejection of Newtonian gravity by George Gleig the chief editor of the rd edition who wrote that gravity was caused by the classical element of fire The Britannica has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to cultural topics as it did with William Robertson Smith s articles on religion in the th edition particularly his article stating that the Bible was not historically accurate Other criticisms The Britannica has received criticism particularly as editions become outdated It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the Britannica and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible usually about years For example despite continuous revision the th edition became outdated after years When American physicist Harvey Einbinder detailed its failings in his book The Myth of the Britannica the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the th edition which required years of work Editors have struggled at times to keep the Britannica current one critic writes it is not difficult to find articles that are out of date or in need of revision noting that the longer Macrop dia articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter Microp dia articles Information in the Microp dia is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding Macrop dia article s mainly because of the failure to update one or the other The bibliographies of the Macrop dia articles have been criticized for being more out of date than the articles themselves In a year old schoolboy in Britain found several inaccuracies in the Britannica s entries on Poland and wildlife in Eastern Europe In an entry about the Irish Civil War which incorrectly described it as having been fought between the north and south of Ireland was discussed in the Irish press following a decision by the Department of Education and Science to pay for online access Writing about the rd edition Britannica s chief editor George Gleig observed that perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan and embracing such a variety of subjects In March the Britannica wrote we in no way mean to imply that Britannica is error free we have never made such a claim However the Britannica sales department had previously made a well known claim in regarding the th edition that i t is truth It is unquestionable fact The sentiment of the statement was also reflected in the introduction to the first edition of the Britannica written by its original editor William Smellie With regard to errors in general whether falling under the denomination of mental typographical or accidental we are conscious of being able to point out a greater number than any critic whatever Men who are acquainted with the innumerable difficulties attending the execution of a work of such an extensive nature will make proper allowances To these we appeal and shall rest satisfied with the judgment they pronounce History Past owners have included in chronological order the Edinburgh Scotland based printers Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell Scottish bookseller Archibald Constable Scottish publisher A C Black Horace Everett Hooper Sears Roebuck and William Benton The present owner of Encyclop dia Britannica Inc is Jacqui Safra a Brazilian billionaire and actor Recent advances in information technology and the rise of electronic encyclopaedias such as Encyclop dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite Encarta and Wikipedia have reduced the demand for print encyclopaedias To remain competitive Encyclop dia Britannica Inc has stressed the reputation of the Britannica reduced its price and production costs and developed electronic versions on CD ROM DVD and the World Wide Web Since the early s the company has promoted spin off reference works Editions The Britannica has been issued in editions with multi volume supplements to the rd and th editions see the Table below The th and th editions were reprints of the th and the th edition was only a supplement to the th just as the th and th editions were supplements to the th The th underwent massive reorganization in but the updated current version is still known as the th The th and th editions were edited every year throughout their runs so that later printings of each were entirely different from early ones Throughout history the Britannica has had two aims to be an excellent reference book and to provide educational material In the th edition adopted a third goal to systematize all human knowledge The history of the Britannica can be divided into five eras punctuated by changes in management or reorganization of the dictionary In the first era st th editions the Britannica was managed and published by its founders Colin Macfarquhar and Andrew Bell by Archibald Constable and by others The Britannica was first published between December and in Edinburgh as the Encyclop dia Britannica or A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences compiled upon a New Plan In part it was conceived in reaction to the French Encyclop die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d Alembert published which had been inspired by Chambers s Cyclopaedia first edition It went on sale December The Britannica of this period was primarily a Scottish enterprise and it is one of the most enduring legacies of the Scottish Enlightenment In this era the Britannica moved from being a three volume set st edition compiled by one young editor William Smellie to a volume set written by numerous authorities Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period among them editions of Abraham Rees s Cyclop dia and Coleridge s Encyclop dia Metropolitana and David Brewster s Edinburgh Encyclop dia During the second era th th editions the Britannica was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm A C Black Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors notably Macvey Napier others were attracted by the Britannica s reputation The contributors often came from other countries and included the world s most respected authorities in their fields A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the th edition a practice maintained until Production of the th edition was overseen by Thomas Spencer Baynes the first English born editor in chief Dubbed the Scholar s Edition the th edition is the most scholarly of all Britannicas After Baynes was assisted by William Robertson Smith No biographies of living persons were included James Clerk Maxwell and Thomas Huxley were special advisors on science However by the close of the th century the th edition was outdated and the Britannica faced financial difficulties In the third era th th editions the Britannica was managed by American businessmen who introduced direct marketing and door to door sales The American owners gradually simplified articles making them less scholarly for a mass market The th edition was an eleven volume supplement including one each of maps and an index to the th numbered as volumes but the th edition was a completely new work and is still praised for excellence its owner Horace Hooper lavished enormous effort on its perfection When Hooper fell into financial difficulties the Britannica was managed by Sears Roebuck for years In the vice president of Sears Elkan Harrison Powell assumed presidency of the Britannica in he began the policy of continuous revision This was a departure from earlier practice in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced at roughly year intervals some articles unchanged from earlier editions Powell developed new educational products that built upon the Britannica s reputation In Sears donated the Encyclop dia Britannica to the University of Chicago William Benton then a vice president of the university provided the working capital for its operation The stock was divided between Benton and the university with the university holding an option on the stock Benton became chairman of the board and managed the Britannica until his death in Benton set up the Benton Foundation which managed the Britannica until and whose sole beneficiary was the University of Chicago In the Britannica celebrated its bicentennial In the fourth era the Britannica introduced its th edition which was reorganized into three parts the Microp dia the Macrop dia and the Prop dia Under Mortimer J Adler member of the Board of Editors of Encyclop dia Britannica since its inception in and its chair from director of editorial planning for the th edition of Britannica from the Britannica sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool but to systematize all human knowledge The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias the Micro and Macrop dia provoked a firestorm of criticism of the initial th edition In response the th edition was completely reorganized and indexed for a re release in This second version of the th edition continued to be published and revised through the release of the print version The official title of the th edition is the New Encyclop dia Britannica although it has also been promoted as Britannica On March the US Federal Trade Commission entered an opinion and order enjoining Encyclop dia Britannica Inc from using a deceptive advertising practices in recruiting sales agents and obtaining sales leads and b deceptive sales practices in the door to door presentations of its sales agents present In the fifth era present digital versions have been developed and released on optical media and online In the Britannica was bought by Jacqui Safra at well below its estimated value owing to the company s financial difficulties Encyclop dia Britannica Incorporated split in One part retained the company name and developed the print version and the other Britannica com Incorporated developed digital versions Since the two companies have shared a CEO Ilan Yeshua who has continued Powell s strategy of introducing new products with the Britannica name In March Britannica s president Jorge Cauz announced that it would not produce any new print editions of the encyclopaedia with the th edition being the last The company will focus only on the online edition and other educational tools Britannica s final print edition was in a volume set Britannica Global Edition was also printed in containing volumes and pages with photographs maps flags and illustrations in smaller compact volumes as well as over articles written by scholars from across the world including Nobel Prize winners Unlike the th edition it did not contain Macro and Microp dia sections but ran
