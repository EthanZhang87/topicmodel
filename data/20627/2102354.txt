A code point codepoint or code position is a unique position in a quantized n dimensional space that has been assigned a semantic meaning In other words a code point is a particular position in a table where the position has been assigned a meaning The table has discrete positions but not fractions and may be one dimensional a column two dimensional like cells in a spreadsheet three dimensional sheets in a workbook etc in any number of dimensions Code points are used in a multitude of formal information processing and telecommunication standards For example ITU T Recommendation T contains a set of country codes for telecommunications equipment originally fax machines which allow equipment to indicate its country of manufacture or operation In T Argentina is represented by the code point x Canada by x Gambia by x etc In character encoding Code points are commonly used in character encoding where a code point is a numerical value that maps to a specific character In character encoding code points usually represent a single grapheme usually a letter digit punctuation mark or whitespace but sometimes represent symbols control characters or formatting The set of all possible code points within a given encoding character set make up that encoding s codespace For example the character encoding scheme ASCII comprises code points in the range hex to Fhex Extended ASCII comprises code points in the range hex to FFhex and Unicode comprises code points in the range hex to FFFFhex The Unicode code space is divided into seventeen planes the basic multilingual plane and supplementary planes each with code points Thus the total size of the Unicode code space is In Unicode For Unicode the particular sequence of bits is called a code unit for the UCS encoding any code point is encoded as byte octet binary numbers while in the UTF encoding different code points are encoded as sequences from one to four bytes long forming a self synchronizing code See comparison of Unicode encodings for details Code points are normally assigned to abstract characters An abstract character is not a graphical glyph but a unit of textual data However code points may also be left reserved for future assignment most of the Unicode code space is unassigned or given other designated functions The distinction between a code point and the corresponding abstract character is not pronounced in Unicode but is evident for many other encoding schemes where numerous code pages may exist for a single code space History The concept of a code point dates to the earliest standards for digital information processing and digital telecommunications In Unicode code points are part of Unicode s solution to a difficult conundrum faced by character encoding developers in the s If they added more bits per character to accommodate larger character sets that design decision would also constitute an unacceptable waste of then scarce computing resources for Latin script users who constituted the vast majority of computer users at the time since those extra bits would always be zeroed out for such users The code point avoids this problem by breaking the old idea of a direct one to one correspondence between characters and particular sequences of bits See also Combining character Replacement character Text based computing Unicode collation algorithm References External links Codepoints net a site dedicated to all things characters letters and Unicode
