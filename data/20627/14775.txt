The inch symbol in or is a unit of length in the British Imperial and the United States customary systems of measurement It is equal to yard or of a foot Derived from the Roman uncia twelfth the word inch is also sometimes used to translate similar units in other measurement systems usually understood as deriving from the width of the human thumb Standards for the exact length of an inch have varied in the past but since the adoption of the international yard during the s and s the inch has been based on the metric system and defined as exactly mm Name The English word inch Old English ynce was an early borrowing from Latin uncia one twelfth Roman inch Roman ounce The vowel change from Latin u to Old English y which became Modern English is known as umlaut The consonant change from the Latin k spelled c to English t is palatalisation Both were features of Old English phonology see Phonological history of Old English Palatalization and Germanic umlaut I mutation in Old English for more information Inch is cognate with ounce Old English ynse whose separate pronunciation and spelling reflect its reborrowing in Middle English from Anglo Norman unce and ounce In many other European languages the word for inch is the same as or derived from the word for thumb as a man s thumb is about an inch wide and this was even sometimes used to define the inch In the Dutch language a term for inch is engelse duim english thumb Examples include Catalan polzada inch and polze thumb Czech palec thumb Danish and Norwegian tomme inch tommel thumb Dutch duim whence Afrikaans duim and Russian French pouce Georgian Hungarian h velyk Italian pollice Portuguese polegada inch and polegar thumb duim Slovak palec thumb Spanish pulgada inch and pulgar thumb and Swedish tum inch and tumme thumb Usage Imperial or hybrid countries The inch is a commonly used customary unit of length in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom For the United Kingdom guidance on public sector use states that since October without time limit the inch along with the foot is to be used as a primary unit for road signs and related measurements of distance with the possible exception of clearance heights and widths and may continue to be used as a secondary or supplementary indication following a metric measurement for other purposes Worldwide Inches are used for display screens e g televisions and computer monitors worldwide It is the official Japanese standard for electronic parts especially display screens and is the industry standard throughout continental Europe for display screens Germany being one of few countries to supplement it with centimetres in most stores Inches are commonly used to specify the diameter of vehicle wheel rims and the corresponding inner diameter of tyres in tyre codes SI countries Both inch based and millimeter based hex keys are widely available for sale in Europe Technical details The international standard symbol for inch is in see ISO Annex A but traditionally the inch is denoted by a double prime which is often approximated by a double quote symbol and the foot by a prime which is often approximated by an apostrophe For example three feet two inches can be written as This is akin to how the first and second cuts of the hour are likewise indicated by prime and double prime symbols and also the first and second cuts of the degree Subdivisions of an inch are typically written using dyadic fractions with odd number numerators for example two and three eighths of an inch would be written as and not as nor as However for engineering purposes fractions are commonly given to three or four places of decimals and have been for many years Equivalents international inch is equal to History The earliest known reference to the inch in England is from the Laws of thelberht dating to the early th century surviving in a single manuscript the Textus Roffensis from Paragraph LXVII sets out the fine for wounds of various depths one inch one shilling two inches two shillings etc An Anglo Saxon unit of length was the barleycorn After inch was equal to barleycorns which continued to be its legal definition for several centuries with the barleycorn being the base unit One of the earliest such definitions is that of where the legal definition of the inch was set out in a statute of Edward II of England defining it as three grains of barley dry and round placed end to end lengthwise Similar definitions are recorded in both English and Welsh medieval law tracts One dating from the first half of the th century is contained in the Laws of Hywel Dda which superseded those of Dyfnwal an even earlier definition of the inch in Wales Both definitions as recorded in Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales vol i pp are that three lengths of a barleycorn is the inch King David I of Scotland in his Assize of Weights and Measures c is said to have defined the Scottish inch as the width of an average man s thumb at the base of the nail even including the requirement to calculate the average of a small a medium and a large man s measures However the oldest surviving manuscripts date from the early th century and appear to have been altered with the inclusion of newer material In Charles Butler a mathematics teacher at Cheam School recorded the old legal definition of the inch to be three grains of sound ripe barley being taken out the middle of the ear well dried and laid end to end in a row and placed the barleycorn not the inch as the base unit of the English Long Measure system from which all other units were derived John Bouvier similarly recorded in his law dictionary that the barleycorn was the fundamental measure Butler observed however that a s the length of the barley corn cannot be fixed so the inch according to this method will be uncertain noting that a standard inch measure was now i e by kept in the Exchequer chamber Guildhall and that was the legal definition of the inch This was a point also made by George Long in his Penny Cyclop dia observing that standard measures had since surpassed the barleycorn definition of the inch and that to recover the inch measure from its original definition in case the standard measure were destroyed would involve the measurement of large numbers of barleycorns and taking their average lengths He noted that this process would not perfectly recover the standard since it might introduce errors of anywhere between one hundredth and one tenth of an inch in the definition of a yard Before the adoption of the international yard and pound various definitions were in use In the United Kingdom and most countries of the British Commonwealth the inch was defined in terms of the Imperial Standard Yard The United States adopted the conversion factor metre inches by an act in In Mendenhall ordered the physical realization of the inch to be based on the international prototype metres numbers and which had been received from the CGPM together with the previously adopted conversion factor As a result of the definitions above the U S inch was effectively defined as mm with a reference temperature of degrees Fahrenheit and the UK inch at mm with a reference temperature of degrees Fahrenheit When Carl Edvard Johansson started manufacturing gauge blocks in inch sizes in Johansson s compromise was to manufacture gauge blocks with a nominal size of mm with a reference temperature of degrees Celsius accurate to within a few parts per million of both official definitions Because Johansson s blocks were so popular his blocks became the de facto standard for manufacturers internationally with other manufacturers of gauge blocks following Johansson s definition by producing blocks designed to be equivalent to his In the British Standards Institution adopted an inch of exactly mm The American Standards Association followed suit in By industry in countries had adopted the industrial inch as it came to be known effectively endorsing Johansson s pragmatic choice of conversion ratio In the Commonwealth Science Congress recommended a yard of exactly metres for adoption throughout the British Commonwealth This was adopted by Canada in the United States on July Australia in effective January and the United Kingdom in effective on January The new standards gave an inch of exactly mm millionths of an inch longer than the old imperial inch and millionths of an inch shorter than the old US inch Related units US survey inches The United States retained the metre definition for surveying producing a millionth part difference between standard and US survey inches This is approximately inch per mile kilometres is exactly standard inches and exactly survey inches This difference is substantial when doing calculations in State Plane Coordinate Systems with coordinate values in the hundreds of thousands or millions of feet In the National Institute of Standards and Technology announced that the U S survey foot would be phased out on January and be superseded by the international foot also known as the foot equal to metres exactly for all further applications This implies that the survey inch was replaced by the international inch Continental inches Before the adoption of the metric system several European countries had customary units whose name translates into inch The French pouce measured roughly mm at least when applied to describe the calibre of artillery pieces The Amsterdam foot voet consisted of Amsterdam inches duim The Amsterdam foot is about shorter than an English foot Scottish inch The now obsolete Scottish inch Scottish Gaelic irleach of a Scottish foot was about imperial inches about mm See also Notes References Citations Bibliography Attenborough F L The
